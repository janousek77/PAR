      <p>Biscuit is waiting to play with you. Biscuit is a shy, 9 month old brown and black tabby who weighs a whopping 5 lbs! He can be somewhat reluctant when it comes to handling by people. We feel he will require a home with an outgoing "mentor" cat to show him the kitty ropes. This shy guy would benefit greatly from a quiet home where he can play and just be a kitten. Due to his shyness, we are looking for an experienced cat owner who can get used to associating pets with love. Biscuit was found as a stray with his littermate in the Yakima area. He has lived with other cats and did well, but we don't know how he would do with dogs. Small children would be too overwhelming for Biscuit, so we are recommending teens and adults in his new home. Show this shy guy some love, won't you?</p>

      <p>Godiva is a bashful, shy girl here with her best friend, Kit Kat. They are looking for a fabulous new home they can share. Godiva is quite bashful, and Kit Kat is the confident and outgoing kitty of the pair. They are looking for a quiet, adult only home where Godiva can really settle in and be comfortable. Kit Kat quickly adjusts to new situations and is eager to explore! He and Godiva are often found playing or snuggling with each other. They are such an adorable pair! While Kit Kat is a confident guy, it's important they find a home familiar with shy cat behavior for Godiva's sake. She will need a little extra TLC to come out of her shell, and needs a patient adopter to help her with that. If you are interested in this dynamic duo, come by today to say hello!</p>

      <p>Hi, my name is Hazel. My previous owner says I am as gentle as a lamb. I do like to play with strings and feathers, but am also low energy and like to relax. It looks like I may have some allergies that affect my skin and fur, so the shelter staff has put me on a hypoallergenic diet, which is by prescription only. If you think I would be a great addition to your home, please be aware that I will require regular veterinary care and possibly medication.</p>

      <p>Say hello to Jackson! This handsome 1 year old domestic shorthair tabby boy is looking forward to starting the search for his forever home in the Seattle area. Jackson came to our rescue after his owner was unable to provide him with the attention and affection Jackson loves most, yet he is optimistic that he will find another family to give him those things and even more! Fans of quiet wallflower cats look elsewhere, because Jackson is a very, very chatty boy who loves to talk up a storm. Jackson is a classic “tree dweller” and loves to perch in lofty spots to observe the world below, but he will also happily accept a window ledge to gaze at the passing birds! Like many cats, Jackson is sensitive to stress and changes in his environment and would do best in a quiet home with children 14 years old and older. However, Jackson previously lived with another cat and a dog without any scuffles, so by all accounts he is a pretty easygoing roommate to other critters! Jackson is incredibly bright and social and would thrive in a home that can provide him with plenty of attention, mental enrichment, playtime, and affection! Not a very tall order, if you ask us – and if you ask Jackson as in the photo above, he will happily agree!
      Jackson is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Jackson!</p>
