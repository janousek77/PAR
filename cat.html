      <div class="description">
      <p>Bailey is a 9 year kitty that lost the only family he ever knew when they adopted a dog. Bailey got too scared and stressed out and they decided to surrender him. When he came to our rescue we found out that he had some neurological problems. These problems make him walk with a swagger. He chirps, loves catnip toys, dinner and is an overall social fellow.</p></div>

      <p>Baldwin is quite the handsome gentleman. He will charm anyone with his movie star good looks. He takes some time to adjust, so he would probably fare better with a cat savvy owner. But once he warms up, he's the sweetest peach in the garden. Looks wise, we'd say he's like a fine wine, he'll just get better with age. DOB ~ 12/24/2009.

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/adult/Becky.jpg"/>
      <h2>Becky</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Becky is an adult cat overflowing with kittenish charms. A diminutive, six-pound bundle of enthusiasm, Becky will bound after you from room to room, chirping happily at frequencies conducive to echolocation. Expect enormous green eyes to meet your own when you open kitchen cabinets; Becky is an intrepid explorer undaunted by heights. Her athletic prowess belies every one of her nine years. A playful presence, Becky is often on the move, patrolling her territory and stalking catnip mice. (Although the hunt usually ends with Becky sprawled across the floor, belly to the sky.)</p><p>
      Becky is as cuddlesome as she is playful. She loves to be scratched under the chin and will express her approbation in a purr loud enough to set her tiny frame quivering. She loves to sleep on the bed (and on its occupant.) Becky can never get enough of human attention; she's also fine with other cats and children.</p></div>

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/adult/Bob.jpg"/>
      <h2>Bob</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Hi, my name is Bob and I love attention! Don't let my tipped ear and rugged good looks fool you; I am a very gentle and affectionate boy who loves being petted and sitting on laps.
      My personality type has been described as a SECRET ADMIRER, and here's what that means:
      When it comes to relationships, I'm very level-headed. I don't leap in paws first, if you know what I mean. But give me a little time, and then I'll shower you with purrs, head-butts, and plenty of lap time. In the meantime, you may not see a lot of me - but I'll be thinking a lot of you.</p><p>
      This wonderful cat has tested positive for FIV. What exactly does that mean? FIV is a cat-only disease and cannot be passed on to humans or other non-felines. It is highly unlikely that an altered, FIV+ cat would spread the disease to other cats in the home - it is only transmitted through blood, and would require a very serious, deep bite wound to do so. This disease predominantly hits unaltered roaming tomcats, fighting to defend their territory.</p><p>
      FIV is a disease of the immune system, and for this reason an FIV+ cat must live indoors only. The good news is that the majority of these cats live long, happy, relatively normal lives with no symptoms at all. Please consider opening up your heart and your home to this deserving cat. Be sure to speak with the shelter officers if you have further questions. Thank you!</p></div>

       <div class="description">
      <p>Casey is the prettiest girl in the whole world, and she just needs someone to reassure her that. Casey is very shy, and has a hard time coming out of her shell. She will need a very special person to help her open up, and be very patient with her. Do you have room in your heart to fit Casey in? DOB ~ 03/17/2013.

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/adult/Cece.jpg"/>
      <h2>CeCe</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>CeCe is a tender-hearted soul who will reward you with love once you've gained her trust. Her past circumstances didn't allow her the calm atmosphere or unencumbered space she enjoys, and now she's looking for a home with a more patient and loving family. Her shy nature doesn't mean she'll spend all of her time exploring remote areas of the house though. CeCe loves cheek rubs, belly scratches, and being brushed. Once she learns to trust in your steady and caring presence, she'll begin seeking you out.</p><p>
      Because of her disposition, CeCe is on a daily dose of anti-anxiety medication that is easily crushed and mixed into her food. She takes her medicine easily and loves you most when you put out a bowl of food for her to eat. If you give CeCe some love and chat with her about your day, she'll enjoy talking back to you with a sweet little meow. Sometimes you may hear her give a half-hearted hiss, but that's only when she's startled; after that immediate reaction she will shortly return to the sweet cat you know and love. Toys and treats definitely help her warm up to you, and it doesn't hurt if you have a toasty warm sunspot in your house either.</p><p>
      CeCe would do best with a mature owner who has previous cat experience and can let her flourish as the only animal in the house. CeCe has good litter box habits and is easily able to entertain herself during the day. But don't stay away too long, because she'll want you back to play with her string toy. Be bold and give a call to see if CeCe could be the perfect match for you!</p></div>

I'll bump you with my head to show you how much I love it! I like to play with my cat friends, and I'm starting to get the hang of playing with toys too! I'd be happiest going home with an outgoing, playful cat like Leucoco so that I can learn more about being a confident cat! DOB ~ 11/07/2016.

He spends a great deal of the afternoons lounged out on the bed, with some breaks for affection here and there. He loves watching the birds from the window, or when they're not around, playing with his ever-so-enticing string toy. Kitterman is outgoing and playful, and if you dare neglect to pet him he will remind you with a sweet and gentle headbutt.

      She wants a home that will treat her as a family member and love her forever. She is about 12 yrs old. In her first home she was very kind and patient with the child of the family, who was about 3 years old. In her second home, she got along with the human residents. She didn't get the medical attention she needed and her kidney disease progressed. She had two homes already, but for one reason or another she ended up back to the rescue. Not her fault, other than needing a little extra care. Because of her kidney disease, she needs sub Q fluids, which she accepts easily. She has a special diet that she gets her medicine in. This is the sweetest cat in the whole world. She would like a home to live in as well as people to love her and take care of her. She is social, talkative and a complete charmer.

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/adult/Opal.jpg"/>
      <h2>Opal</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>OPAL was brought to SAS in late November, along with 2 or 3 other cats. Her ‘sad eyes' look seems to mirror a short indoor/outdoor lifestyle, without much care from her former humans. She was in poor condition and very pregnant, ready to deliver kittens at time of surrender.
      She was taken into a foster home and her overall condition has improved considerably since that time.
      Her age is unknown but her behavior and activity level is that of a very young cat, possibly 1 or 2 years old.
      A little shy with strangers, she is receptive to kindness and attention from people. As a pretty, flame point Siamese cat, her talkative nature seems to fit the traits of her breed. Her routine chatter is easily distinguished from a tone of distress when something upsets her.</p><p>
      Opal delivered five kittens the day after Thanksgiving and devoted her attention to them for nearly three months. Though not much is known about her former stay with prior owner, she did not like the other cats in the household. She has retained some wariness from earlier experiences, though she can be in same room with other cats, as long as they don't confront her. Based on that discomfort, she would probably do best in a quiet household with no other pets or small children. However, she continued to enjoy the company of her five kittens, even as they became very independent and more interactive with each other. Opal has been seen on many occasions chasing her very active kittens, playing with them and with favorite toys.</p><p>
      Four of her kittens are recently adopted or about to be adopted. That still leaves an opportunity for Opal to have a companion in a new home if she is adopted with her remaining daughter, Onyx (in the photos with her). They get along well with each other, are both playful, and receptive to human attention.
      Do you have a home to offer this sweet cat, and give her a chance for a better life in a loving home?
      If you are interested in meeting Opal and her kitten, Onyx, please contact Joan at wolfbird50@comcast.net</p>

      <p>Pinky is an outgoing, curious and loving kitty that, once comfortable, will sit on your lap in the day and snuggle with you at night. She loves to look out the window and longs to catch the birds feeding outside. Because she is polydactyl, her paws look like little mittens! She enjoys food, maybe a little too much, so her diet must be closely monitored. As a long haired kitty, she requires daily brushing to keep her coat free of tangles. Come meet this sassy lady!</p>

      <p>Ryder is a sweet, handsome little tabby who is somewhat shy but in the week or so he's been in foster care he's warmed up a lot and is getting calmer and friendlier every day. He likes exploring and finding Ryder-sized hiding spots around the house that he can spy on you from. Despite being somewhat skittish he's very hungry for attention - when you stop petting him he will hop up and down and sometimes stand on his hind legs to try to get you to come back. He loves being brushed and using blankets to wrap himself up like a tiny, furry burrito. Ryder would benefit from a quiet household and a little time and patience to help him come out of his shell.</p></div>

      <div class="description">
      <p>Are you in search of a smart, handsome, and playful cat who also loves to snuggle next to you and is an excellent biscuit maker? Well, Shadow may be the cat to end your search. This 3 year old classic tuxedo kitty leans into or stands on his back feet during ear/neck/chin rubs and pets to show his appreciation. He also enjoys being picked up, held and of course given some ear rubs at the same time. If you haven't been giving him enough attention he will remind you with a meow or two or three. His toys of choice are string toys and soft catnip toys. His foster hasn't seen him play with ping pong balls or jingle balls, but she has heard him play with them. With Shadow being such a smart feline, his foster mom is working with him on some ticks using his favorite, seafood flavored crunchy treats, as his prize. Shadow will need a person who has cat experience, so he isn't the feline for a first time cat parent. Come meet the cat who will always be impeccably dressed.</p></div>

      <div class="description">
      <p>Sonny is a beautiful Red Tabby with Harlequin coloration. He is a healthy, chubby 4 year old, whose previous owner had to give him up because she couldn't find housing that would accept pets.
      Sonny seems to be a one-person cat, who enjoys company and affection, once he gets to know you.</p><p>
      Sonny is challenging at first, because he has problems establishing trust. To be clear, he can be very fearful and even aggressive toward strangers, until he learns to trust. He needs a very cat-savvy adopter who will take the time to get Sonny to trust you. We suspect that he prefers women to men.
      Sonny is in dire need of being adopted, because his present foster mom, a frequent rescue foster parent, cannot keep him. We need to make room for more fosters, as the difficult-to-adopt ones keep coming in!</p></div>

She came into the shelter in bad shape with super itchy and bothersome skin allergies but we've figured out how to help her enjoy life again! Cali is hoping that the right person will be so happy to have such a sweet and lovable girl in their life that they will be OK with the few extra needs she's got. She eats a prescription food (licks her bowl clean!) gets a 1/4 pill every 3 days (she's easy to pill!) and the vet recommends giving her Advantage monthly (gosh, this could be any cat!). Cali wants to find someone who doesn't have too many other critters in the house and is generous with their belly scratches!</p>

      <h2>Eddie</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Searching for someone to inspire you? Eddie sets a perfect example of how to overcome challenges with a sunny spirit. This pretty tuxedo kitty is one of the most affectionate cats you'll ever meet. She loves cheek and chin rubs, curling up on laps, sleeping in the sun with her belly showing, and snuggling by her foster mom's shoulder so she can share the pillow. She also likes to sprawl with her legs in front of her to groom her tummy, sitting up like a person while she cares for her extra soft and velvety coat. She is a confident, chatty girl and a lively companion.</p><p>
      Eddie is mildly vision-impaired (although you wouldn't know it from looking at her beautiful green eyes) but she doesn't let it bother her at all and uses all her other senses to compensate for her poor eyesight. She is very vocal, purring constantly and talking to you in her unique voice. She loves to chase her bird toy and her rattling ball - both of these toys make noise so she can track them easily. She tends to play with all four paws on the ground, or rolling on her back, instead of jumping. She uses her sense of touch too, sometimes gently tapping her person to communicate, especially at mealtime. She manages her vision impairment very well and her foster parent can share tips to help mitigate its impact on her life.</p><p>
      Eddie is also FIV+, but in good health for her age and doesn't take any medications. For more information about living with an FIV+ cat, please visit </p>

She's got diabetes, but she's on a very low dose of insulin and takes her medicine without fuss. In return, she will be a very bonded companion to you and so happy to have a home to call her own!
      This warm and patient Katniss is good with kids who understand how to read a cat's signals. She'd do well in a moderately active home and would enjoy the company of a feline friend. Call the foster care hotline above to schedule a time to meet Katniss. </p>

      <h2>Lillie</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Lillie is a fabulous, independent, (almost) 9-year old, delightful girl. We have had the awesome experience being her foster parents. She took her sweet time getting to know us, preferring to hang alone than with us. And we let her. Well, I have to admit, I tried to get to be her friend before she wanted me to. She's just SO cute looking, I couldn't resist! Lillie is a gray tabby with a thick black stripe along her spine and a darling white, tan and gray face. Her eyes are green and her paws are white.</p><p>
      Lillie has a funny personality and she will let you know when she wants to eat and when you need to clean her litter box (twice a day) and when she wants you to follow her somewhere (usually the kitchen for food) and when she wants you to pet her. Lillie is very vocal, so you'll know what she wants and when she wants it. She will definitely make you laugh. Lillie will not do well with other pets or commotion in a house. She would prefer a single person or couple without children. Other than all that, she is one perfect cat. She doesn't jump up on furniture or kitchen counters. She has perfect litter box habits.</p></div>

      <h2>Lilyput</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Lilyput is a sweet and gentle 12 year old girl. While being very independent, she loves a scratch behind her ears and under her chin. Lilyput enjoys human company and will gladly sit next to you while you watch TV or read a book. She loves a good catnip toy and will playfully roll around with it for hours. Lilyput is tolerant of other cats but would do best in a quiet home without small kids. One look into her big blue eyes and you will fall in love with Lilyput.</p><p>
      Being a 12 year old cat, Lilyput does have some kidney-related medical issues; therefore, she must be fed a kidney-care diet. She gladly eats this food and will let you know when she wants some more!</p><p>
      I'm happy to introduce you to Miss Panda. She was first adopted out from Seattle Animal Shelter when she was just a kitten. 12 years later she was returned by workers employed to remove trash from an apartment where she was found. Panda was neglected and distrustful when she first arrived back at SAS. When taken in as a foster she immediately flourished into an affectionate and joyful cat who quickly claimed a favorite window sill to watch the world go by and a favorite hiding place in the back of the closet to take a nap in private. But most of all she likes company and is quick to nestle near her favorite person in hopes of getting some attention. She enjoys her catnip toys and is a diligent user of her cat scratcher. She is also dependable on using the litter box.
      She often comes excitedly to the door to greet you when you arrive home. This seems to happen more when she is fed her preference, canned food</p>

      <div class="description">
      <p>Missy is an extremely snuggly and loving cat and is always looking for a warm lap to stretch out on. She loves to be pet (especially behind and around her ears) and is often eager for belly rubs. Missy is a quiet cat, perfect for an apartment setting with neighbors, or a quiet home. She is friendly to new guests and her gentle purr and silky soft fur will will draw them in. She enjoys the occasional play, but generally spends her time stretched out on a cozy surface. Missy will make an excellent companion for a cat-experienced, calm, and mature household</p>

      <h2>Nadia</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Nadia is a spritely petite kitty who will wow you with her acrobatic skill. She likes to be the center of attention and will perform great feats of agility for you and your guests, especially if she is hungry or feeling left out of the conversation. She is a champ at feather game who will do somersaults on your hand to get rubbed in just the right place. She has a face like a Picasso and her ears have lynx type tips.
      While Nadia does not like to get picked up, she is a sweet lap cat who loves to be invited to sit with you, or preferably on you. She is very talkative and will carry on conversations with you and likes to be nearby and will even escort you around the house. She appears to prefer being indoors and content to watch activity outside from a window. She can be delightful company.
      Nadia's work out schedule requires that she have mostly wet food with pumpkin to keep things moving but otherwise she appears quite healthy and fit. She is very diligent about using the scratching post and the litter box. She has a hearty appetite and loves a treat of cream now and then.</p>

      <h2>Oscar</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Oscar is a sweet, easygoing, even-tempered, mild-mannered thirteen year old. He is shy at first but once he's comfortable he is affectionate and engaging. He comes when called because he knows he's going to get a pet or a good scratch or maybe just a little conversation. He likes to be close to you when you are relaxing either sitting right on you or sitting nearby. He will come to you when he sees you recumbent. He likes to play with Da Bird and will race around the house for a minute or two every now and then. Mostly, he likes to sit and watch the world go by or curl up and nap. He's good company and he will do best with a quiet house where he is the only animal. Oscar takes a low dose of medication daily but takes his pill like a pro!</p>

      <h2>Pumpkin</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Pumpkin is a friendly yet independent fellow who will make a wonderful companion. He loves attention - especially being brushed with the Zoom Groom - and also enjoys a daily play session or two with balls and other chase toys. Two of his favorite occasional treats are catnip and kitty grass, and he is a neat kitty who likes to use his scratching post. Pumpkin found himself at the shelter through no fault of his own because his owner had to move. He is confident in his fur and knows that he'd like his forever home to be with mature guardians who understand cats. If you admire a fellow who knows his mind, and are looking for a mellow and heartbreakingly handsome companion, Pumpkin may be the cat for you!</p></div>

      <div class="description">
      <p>Rita is a gentle, sweet lady looking for a quiet forever home to fill with her purrs. Although she's visually impaired she doesn't let this slow her down and eagerly explores new places and meets new people. She needs one pill in morning that she happily takes with food to treat her high blood pressure and prevent her vision from getting worse and food available from any vet to protect her kidneys. Rita loves pets and will often come to cuddle at night on your bed. Her favorite position is to sleep against you. She'll even wait quietly by the door at bedtime to make sure she gets her spot. Don't her big eyes just beg for some affection? Her calm demeanor is perfect for a relaxed household and she doesn't mind other cats as long as they don't invade her bubble. Let Rita warm up your home and bring a little peace to you today!</p>

      <h2>Samantha</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Sweet Samantha has many endearing qualities. She is friendly, affectionate, gentle, and as curious as every self-respecting cat should be. She enjoys being brushed and sitting on laps, and does not hesitate to share her soothing, steady purr. She currently shares her foster home with both cats and dogs and gets along well with them. She is quite spry and loves to chase the bird toy and bat at a cat nip mouse. Then she settles in for a nice nap, preferably on the bed right next to you. Samantha will make a wonderfully loving companion for some lucky person. Might that be you?</p><p>
      Like all sidekicks, I'm just plain good company. I like attention, and I also like my solitude. I don't go looking for trouble but I'm no scaredy-cat, either. If you are looking for a steady companion to travel with you on the road of life, look no further.</p></div>

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/elderly/Zoe.jpg"/>
      <h2>Zoe</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Zoe has been a highly affectionate, quirky part of my household. Let me see if I can describe her for you.
      Zoe, after being fearful and reserved when she arrived, has slowly shown that she loves social contact, both with humans and other cats. She comes to hop into my lap whenever I sit down to work at my computer or settle in to do some reading in my recliner. I barely get into bed at night before I find her curled up at the top of my bed, near my head. I sometimes wake in the morning to find her asleep on my back! She's also tries to stay engaged with Shermy, my old male cat. (He's sort of a grump, so she doesn't get much success.)</p><p>
      Zoe loves to bask in the sunshine that (occasionally!) comes in through my south facing windows. She also enjoys playing with catnip toys, most frequently thumping a cigar-shaped toy with her back legs.</p><p>
      Zoe is a voracious eater - she can sometimes make a mess with her dry food, but she ends up eating all of it. She doesn't seem to get overweight, despite her appetite. She's never had a litter box problem and is in good health.</p><p>
      Zoe has quirks. As I mentioned, she was highly fearful when she came to my home. She spent ~ 4 days hiding behind the toilet in my bathroom and then another ~ 8 days hiding under my living room couch before she started to come out into the daily flow of events. Her fearfulness and withdrawal do not disappear at some specific point; rather, she gradually, gradually, gradually gives them up. She's loyal and loving, but it takes time to earn those feelings from her.</p><p>
      Zoe walks and trots normally around my home, but has a problem with her hind legs such that she can only jump small heights. She can hop up onto my couch, but cannot go even a few inches higher onto my bed or my computer chair. I've gotten three small "pet steps" that I've strategically put around my home, so we no longer face Zoe trying to climb and pull herself up to desired heights.</p><p>
      I hope these comments give you a feeling for Zoe. I'm certainly glad to answer any questions you might have. You're also welcome to come to my home if you'd like, although both Zoe and Shermy are almost certain to run and hide during your visit!</p>

      <h2>Biscuit</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Biscuit is waiting to play with you. Biscuit is a shy, 9 month old brown and black tabby who weighs a whopping 5 lbs! He can be somewhat reluctant when it comes to handling by people. We feel he will require a home with an outgoing "mentor" cat to show him the kitty ropes. This shy guy would benefit greatly from a quiet home where he can play and just be a kitten. Due to his shyness, we are looking for an experienced cat owner who can get used to associating pets with love. Biscuit was found as a stray with his littermate in the Yakima area. He has lived with other cats and did well, but we don't know how he would do with dogs. Small children would be too overwhelming for Biscuit, so we are recommending teens and adults in his new home. Show this shy guy some love, won't you?</p>

Godiva is quite bashful, and Kit Kat is the confident and outgoing kitty of the pair. They are looking for a quiet, adult only home where Godiva can really settle in and be comfortable. Kit Kat quickly adjusts to new situations and is eager to explore! He and Godiva are often found playing or snuggling with each other. They are such an adorable pair! While Kit Kat is a confident guy, it's important they find a home familiar with shy cat behavior for Godiva's sake. She will need a little extra TLC to come out of her shell, and needs a patient adopter to help her with that. If you are interested in this dynamic duo, come by today to say hello!</p></div>

      <div class="description">
      <p>Hi, my name is Hazel. My previous owner says I am as gentle as a lamb. I do like to play with strings and feathers, but am also low energy and like to relax. It looks like I may have some allergies that affect my skin and fur, so the shelter staff has put me on a hypoallergenic diet, which is by prescription only. If you think I would be a great addition to your home, please be aware that I will require regular veterinary care and possibly medication.</p></div>

      <h2>Jackson</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Say hello to Jackson! This handsome 1 year old domestic shorthair tabby boy is looking forward to starting the search for his forever home in the Seattle area. Jackson came to our rescue after his owner was unable to provide him with the attention and affection Jackson loves most, yet he is optimistic that he will find another family to give him those things and even more! Fans of quiet wallflower cats look elsewhere, because Jackson is a very, very chatty boy who loves to talk up a storm. Jackson is a classic “tree dweller” and loves to perch in lofty spots to observe the world below, but he will also happily accept a window ledge to gaze at the passing birds! Like many cats, Jackson is sensitive to stress and changes in his environment and would do best in a quiet home with children 14 years old and older. However, Jackson previously lived with another cat and a dog without any scuffles, so by all accounts he is a pretty easygoing roommate to other critters! Jackson is incredibly bright and social and would thrive in a home that can provide him with plenty of attention, mental enrichment, playtime, and affection! Not a very tall order, if you ask us – and if you ask Jackson as in the photo above, he will happily agree!
      Jackson is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Jackson!</p>
