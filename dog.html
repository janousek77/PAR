      <p>Hi there! My name is Alberta, and I'm a recent Seattle transplant looking for my forever home. I've had a bit of a rough start to life, but I arrived here thanks to Wings of Rescue, and I'm ready to write my story anew. I'm a quiet, calm girl and I'm pretty shy but I LOVE toys, especially the squeaky kind. I can live with dog and cat siblings who will respect my space, but I'm fine being an only dog as well. I could be the perfect apartment or condo dog as my previous owner trained me to use puppy pads.
      I'm looking for a quiet home with humans who have previous shy dog experience who are ready to work with me to help me come out of my shell. It will definitely take me some time to get to know you, but I think it will be super rewarding. Will you be my person? Apply to meet me today!

      <p>Baby is a sweet girl that is excited about life and meeting new people. She has lived around kids before but she can be a little excited so you will need to watch her and make sure she knows not to play too rough. She does not appreciate the antics of other canines and will need a feline free home. Medical info; Baby has a torn cruciate that may or may not require surgery in the future.</p>

      <p>My name is Bailey and I am available for adoption at the RASKC Pet Adoption Center in Kent.I was brought in by my previous owner on 3/25/17 because I don't like other dogs. I lived in a home with older children. My previous owner described me as playful.My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!I am a very smart dog! I have shown my caregivers that I already know how to "sit", "stay", "come", "down" and "shake".I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs. I may do best as the only dog in my new home, or need to meet other dogs in the home first.When I get nervous I may show my teeth, but don't worry I am actually smiling. When I am scared I smile to be submissive.Adoption Fee: $200.00

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Capone.jpg"/>
      <p>Meet Capone, one of our new rescue arrivals! Capone is looking forward to starting the search for his forever home in the Seattle area. When it comes to handsome, this four year old Pekingese mix boy could put any runway model to shame! With his adorable face and underbite, Capone’s got himself quite a cute mug and a whole lot more to offer to just the right person. Although Capone has made some human friends, he can be a touch fearful at first with new people. With respect, a gentle touch and plenty of treats to reward his progress, Capone will show you his friendly, affectionate side! Before long, you can expect to enjoy plenty of cuddles and snuggles, complete with belly rubs and a tail that won’t stop wagging! Capone does not like his kennel, and will grumble to tell you all about it, so he would do best not being crated or kenneled while left alone at home. Because of Capone’s initial fear, he would thrive best in a home with respectful humans 12 years and older. And, treats of all kinds are more than welcome and encouraged!
      Capone is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Capone!</p>

      <p>Please give a warm welcome to Cha Cha, one of our new rescue arrivals! This tiny little 10 year old Chihuahua cutie pie comes all the way from California, and she can’t wait to start the search for her forever home in the Seattle area. Sweet little Cha Cha is as adorable as she is itty bitty, which is to say, very much so! Cha Cha may be small in stature, but don’t let that fool you – underneath her gentle, delicate demeanor lies a confident little gal who can be choosy with her doggie friends and communicates very well with them. Along with sniffing and exploring, Cha Cha counts among her favorite things cuddles, snuggles, lap sessions, kisses, closeness, and butt scratches! Cha Cha is such a mellow, gentle little girl that she would make a great fit for a first time dog owner, but would prefer a home with humans ages 14 years old and older. If small, sweet and snuggly is on your list, Cha Cha may just have your number!
      Cha Cha is fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Cha Cha!</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Chewey.jpg"/>
      <p>Meet Chewey! This handsome 4-year old Chihuahua mix boy is excited to start the search for his forever home. After receiving surgery for a ruptured disc, Chewey has been using a wheelchair, but is regaining the use of his back legs and becoming less dependant on his wheelchair to get around! With continued physical therapy, Chewey may be able to ditch his wheels completely one day! Charismatic, friendly, and very sweet, Chewey tolerates other dogs, but would be happiest as the only dog in the home so he has plenty of room for his big personality to shine. Chewey does not get along well with cats.
      Chewey is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. Call Emerald City Pet Rescue at 206-557-4661 to meet Chewey!</p>

      <img class="middle-img" src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Chewy.jpg"/>
      <p>Chewy is a big lovable goof looking for his new home. Chewy needs to be the only pet in the home as he loves to be the center of attention and doesn't get along with other animals in the home. He loves car rides and going to groomers! He likes to play tug o war and chase balls. He knows lots of commands and loves to slobber all over everyone! Chewy has separation anxiety so he will need a home with someone who is around most of the time. He cannot be crated as well. He loves to chew and will need plenty of toys! Chewy likes to jump on people and can topple over little kids there for anyone in the home should be over 7. Chewy also gets overly excited with tennis balls and can swallow them so we don't recommend any.</p>

       <img src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Chloe.jpg"/>
      <p>Hello! I'm Chloe and I am so ready to find my forever home. My life before coming into the shelter wasn't the happiest so it was really hard for me to trust humans, but since going into my foster home I have learned to love and fully trust my foster parents. With slow and consistent introductions I've learned to let a few other people into my inner circle of trust as well and I can't wait to meet someone willing to be patient with me so I can spend the rest of my days with them, snuggling under the covers! I'm already house trained, so no worries there!
      A yard would be nice but I LOVE going on walks and using my nose every day. I love meeting people and dogs on my walks. I'd be fine as a single dog so I could get all of your love and attention but I think I'd like a doggy playmate as well, as long as they're easy going and are good at communicating. No human children or cats, please; children are too unpredictable and cats are just too fun to chase.
      The humans want my forever family to have experience with herding/high drive breeds since I can be nervous in new situations and have a moderate amount of energy, and my new home will need to be a pretty relaxed place without lots of comings and goings while I get acclimated. If you're looking for a devoted, goofy, super snuggly best friend look no farther!</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/cinnamon.jpg"/>
      <p>Say hello to Cinnamon, one of our adoptable rescue pets! At two years young, this Chiweenie cutie pie is excited to start the search for a forever home of her own. Cinnamon has had some experiences in her past that have caused her to be reactive and fearful in certain situations, so Cinnamon would benefit most from an experienced adopter who can give her the guidance and training she needs to build her confidence. After all that she has been through, Cinnamon hopes to find someone to give her a chance and support her through her progress and setbacks, because she truly wants to trust and love humans. Cinnamon is a great communicator and always lets you know when she’s feeling happy and brave, or when she feels insecure and frightened, and in time you will see her great capacity for love and affection! When Cinnamon trusts you, she lets her guard down and reveals her cuddly, snuggly, sweet side. Due to her fear, Cinnamon hopes to find a forever home without any children. However, a home with cats and other dogs are no problem at all, especially if you can keep the treats and cuddles coming her way!
      Cinnamon is fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped. For more information or to meet Cinnamon, please contact Emerald City Pet Rescue at 206-557-4661</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/daryl.jpg"/>
      <p>Daryl is a very strong headed male. He is 75lbs about 4 years old he is crate trained needs more training with obedience but is a quick learn. He is great with other dogs on slow introductions and then once he is friends he is friends for life.....but because of this he would never be really good for a off leash dog park type of dog. He will wait for the squirrels on the fence line 24 hours a day. He loves to hug very affectionate. He is not food aggressive....but he can be a resource guarder with cloth items it is very strange but he just is. Can explain more verbally. If you have any other questions please email at Kelly at K9WRINKLES@AOL.COM</p>

      <p>Please give a warm welcome to Deena, one of our new rescue arrivals! This 4 year old Yorkie mix gal is looking forward to finding her forever home in the Seattle area. While Deena’s past may be a mystery, there is no question that this girl has a great capacity for love when it comes to humans! This super sweet little lady may be a bit shy at first meeting, but warms up with a patient approach and respectful handling. Darling Deena especially enjoys the company of women and gives kisses and cuddles easily once you have her trust! Deena also has a playful side which will have you in stitches as she makes the funniest little grumbles and growls while playing with you. Due to her initial shyness and distaste for slip leads, Deena would thrive in a home with other dogs, and respectful humans ages 14 years and up. For a lovely combination of affection, playfulness, loyalty, and spunk, look no further than our doll, Deena!
      Deena is fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Deena!</p>

Elliott is fine with most other dogs and enjoys a great game of fetch, eating treats, and wagging his little nub of a tail to show he is happy.

Elliott is best suited for a home with humans over 16 years old, does fine with confident cats, and is a huge hit with anyone who loves good looks and a sweet personality.

      <p>Just go with the.. Flo! Jedi is here with his sister Flo, and they are looking for a loving home they can share. This sweet duo has spent their whole lives in a shelter, and are so ready to finally have a home to call their own! Jedi and Flo like to take life easy, love nap time, and make great cuddle buddies! They get along with other friendly and polite dogs, but as long as they have each other they are happy. They are looking for an easy going home where they can relax and take life at their own pace. Jedi and Flo are best suited with respectful children who can understand that this lovely pair can be a bit bashful at times. If your home (and heart!) is big enough to welcome this dynamic duo, come by and meet them today!</p>

      <p>I'm Frida, aka "Frito!" At 7 pounds and 2 years of age, I'm a sprightly, playful Chihuahua/Italian Greyhound Mix. I'm all legs, eyes and ears! I actually have only 3 legs now, as one was recently amputated, but this does not slow me down! I love to play fetch and can run FAST. I throw my toys around, and would love to live with a compatible, playful dog (not too rough!) I keep trying to get the senior dog in my foster home to play, but she's not taking the bait, despite my frequent asks. I will keep trying....
      I need a knowledgeable family who's truly dedicated to the task of completing my house training, and I want a fun, active home, but as I startle easily, young kids are not appropriate for me./p>

      <p>Jade is a shy little dog who has been passed around a bit. Once she warms up she wants to be your best friend. She has done ok with other dogs her size here but we are unsure how she will be with cats. Any children in the home should be over the age of 12 years and respectful of small shy dogs.</p>

      <p>Jake is a sweet guy who has a problem with livestock. From rabbits to alpacas Jake does not do well with them and CANNOT live with any small critters or farm animals. His previous owners said he did ok with other dogs and cats. He knows a lot of commands and does well with clicker training. Jake did well with older kids because of his energy level, He loves to play chase but he's not so good at bringing it back. He would make a great family dog for adopters with knowledge about his breed. His only other bad habit is he digs holes and chases cars. Jake is not suited for an apartment and needs a fenced, secure yard.</p>

        <p>Meet Kona, one of our new rescue arrivals! At seven years young, this Dachshund / Chihuahua mix came to us after being picked on by the cats and dog in his previous home. Poor little Kona was scared and intimidated by his canine and feline roommates, and is now eager to start the search for a forever home where he can finally let loose and relax. This friendly fellow is quick to approach new people for a little petting or a belly rub, and will show you how happy he is with adorable grunts! When Kona isn’t kissing you or enjoying a cuddle, his tail wags endlessly as he tries to earn treats (one of his favorite things). Although Kona takes verbal correction well, he can be rather vocal and may do best in a house rather than an apartment or condo. Kona would prefer a home with humans ages 14 and up, and would love an active family that will let him share in some safe fun in the great outdoors (always on leash, of course)!
        Kona is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Kona!</p>

        <p>Meet Lincoln! At 5 years old, Lincoln came all the way from Soi Dogs in Thailand to join the ECPR Family! Cuddly, friendly Lincoln has quickly become a staff favorite. Lincoln is a sweet, well-socialized fella, who makes the funniest noises when he’s trying to communicate with you. Lincoln is very treat motivated and learns quickly, and is very good at communicating with other dogs, though he can be impatient with them from time to time, so Lincoln would prefer a home with either senior or mellow dogs (or, ideally, he could be the only dog in the home and hold the spotlight all on his own). Lincoln is looking for an active family that will take him on daily hikes and adventures where he can show off his amazing walking skills! Lincoln needs a cat-free home, and because he can be vocal, apartments and condos are not for him, either. Because of his past, Lincoln requires a home with a fenced yard to prevent him from escaping, must remain 100% on leash or tethered, and would prefer a home with people 12 years old and up. A lot of training will be required for Lincoln, so experienced adopters who can provide him with these opportunities are ideal for him. Are you the right match for this international super-dog?
        Lincoln is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. For more information on Lincoln, please call Emerald City Pet Rescue: 206.557.4661.</p>

      <p>Lion is a cute and lovable boy. He will thrive in a semi-active, pet savvy, mature home where he can be your one and only 4-legged companion. Lion is very affectionate and would make a GREAT companion dog. He loves to sit with you while your reading the paper, working, or just hanging out. But during bedtime, he prefers to be alone on his own bed - Lion needs beauty sleep! He is very playful and he will flourish in a home where he will get lots of opportunities to play, go for walks and frolic. Lion will benefit from training. He is eager to please, so he should be a good student. This wonderful fellow is an absolute sweetheart, and I'm not "lion". Come meet him and see for yourself.</p>

        <p>Meet Lois Lane! Lois is a 3 year old American Bulldog looking for a very special forever home. This very sweet, smiley, boisterous gal loves to play and throw her weight around, so must go to a household with no small children (as she may knock them right on over in a fit of joy) or dogs smaller than ~40 lbs. Seriously though, have you ever seen a prettier smile on a more photogenic face? Lois is looking for an adopter who is willing to continue her manners training and to work on her leash walking skills. Her dream home would be fairly active and up for fun and games (though Lois also loves to cuddle and lounge around!) with experienced adopters of larger breed dogs. Lois wouldn’t mind another well-behaved, large canine sibling to hang out with either. Lois would like a home with no cats, critters or small dogs. Lois is a staff favorite and deserves the best home…is it yours?
        Lois Lane is fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped. Please call Emerald City Pet Rescue at 206-557-4661 to meet Lois!</p>

        <p>Say hello to Lucy, one of our new rescue arrivals! This 3 year old Lab mix lady is looking forward to finding her forever home in the Seattle area. When it comes to Lucy, it’s go, go, go – this active girl needs an active family to keep up with her on adventures like hikes, jogs, and plenty of walks around the neighborhood! However, Lucy’s energy is also tempered by a sweet, affectionate, and very obedient side, as she loves to make people smile by showing off her knowledge of basic commands. This lovely girl is so happy with people that she positively vibrates with joy when you meet her, and she loves to stick by your side and show her endless loyalty! Lucy’s idea of a perfect day is playing fetch with a ball, taking a jog or a hike, and then snuggling next to her human on the sofa with some treats on standby. Due to her strong prey drive for furry things smaller than her, she should ideally be the only dog in the home, but might be able to strike up a friendship with a dog her size or larger. When it comes to humans of all ages and sizes, Lucy is a big hit and would love to be the newest member of your family!
        Lucy is fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Lucy!</p>

Miss Luna enjoys the company of other dogs, but does prefer a more easy going male to be her buddy. Come by and meet this lovely lady today!</p>

        <p>Meet the sweet Marco! This 2 year-old Pit Bull mix boy is sweet, cuddly, and “Terrier brained” (i.e. short attention span). A great walker, this adorable little guy is very protective of his food and treats, so don’t plan on sharing with him until you’ve helped him refine his manners through training which would be a great benefit to Marco. Marco would love a home with an adopter who is experienced with his breed, and needs to be the only animal in the home. However, we are sure Marco has more than enough companionship, affection, and love to fill any home to capacity. We are unsure of how Marco does with children at this time.
        Marco is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. Please call Emerald City Pet Rescue if you'd like to meet Marco: 206.557.4661.</p>

        <p>Meet Matilda, one of our new rescue arrivals! This beautiful little 6 year old Chihuahua mix lady is excited to get the search underway for her forever home in the Seattle area. Matilda has a condition called “ataxia”, which causes her wobbly, uneven walking style. However, Matilda hasn’t let the condition dampen her sunny spirits and she still gets around just fine! Matilda is about as sweet as they come, with an affectionate disposition that comes through as she leans against you for petting sessions and follows you around the room like an adorable, fluffy little shadow! Miss Matilda is a gentle, snuggly soft girl who prefers the quiet life to a lot of adventure and excitement, and she would make a wonderful cuddle buddy or lap dog for a very lucky person. When Matilda isn’t curiously exploring the world around her, she can be found making friends with other dogs and earning her distinction of “kennel favorite” with ease! Because of Matilda’s condition, she would benefit most from a carpeted home with no big dogs and respectful children 14 years old and older.
        Matilda is fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Matilda!</p>

      <p>Midnight is a handsome active lab ready for a new home. He will need plenty of exercise and training. Midnight came to us as a stray so we don't know too much about him. His new home should not have any cats or other dogs. He really has not done well with other canines here. Any kids in the home should be dog savvy and over 7 years old. He is very smart and tends to look for an escape route when left alone outside. Midnight needs a home where he can run and play so apartments aren't a good fit. Midnight is not a dog who can go to the dog park or other events where other dogs will be around.</p>

I need dog companions!I am a very active and silly dog! My caregivers can't get over how adorable my face is and I have a huge personality to match. Once comfortable and confident in my surroundings, I am very sweet and playful. I love walks, playing with rope toys, and playing with other dogs!I am looking for a family that is dog savvy and has worked with intelligent, but easily frightened, dogs before. Experience with terriers is preferred since we have a lot of personality and training needs packed into our scruffy little bodies!I will do best in an adult only home as I get very nippy when I am playing and am not comfortable being picked up. I will happily jump right into your lap for some love though!Because I am not comfortable when alone, I will need another social, patient dog or a pack to be a part of. My dog friends at the shelter have helped me learn how to be a dog and even how to play with other dogs! I do not want to lose that in my new home by being the only dog in my new home. When alone, I have displayed some separation anxiety related behaviors. I am looking for a family familiar with working with a dog with separation anxiety. Having another dog in the home may also help reduce my anxiety when my people are not around.My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!If you would like more information about me, please call (425) 406-8081 or come to the Eastside Pet Adoption Center inside the Kirkland Petco to meet me!Adoption Fee: $200.00

        <p>Meet Rennie, one of our new rescue arrivals! This handsome 6 year old terrier mix boy is eager to start the search for his forever home in the Seattle area. Rennie came to us with a heartbreaking story, having been dumped in a California shelter where he was so scared that he rapidly lost weight due to stress and fear. Since then, Rennie has come such a long way, in part due to the help from various rescue groups and fosters who would not give up on him! Rennie started out very under-socialized, but after 6 weeks of training with Tug Dogs in Sacramento and tons of treats and love, Rennie is well on his way to being a very well-behaved boy! Agile, playful and affectionate, Rennie is a big fan of walks and edible chew toys and would make a great companion for someone with an active lifestyle. Though Rennie is not fond of crating or kenneling, he is great with other large dogs his size that can give him clear social cues, as he is still learning the ropes. Because Rennie is extremely curious and active, a fully fenced and completely secure yard is required for his safety. An experienced adopter is preferred, but anyone ages 10 years old and up that have patience, guidance, and plenty of love to offer would be a welcome fit for Rennie!
        Rennie is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Rennie!</p>

This darling Boston Terrier duo is excited to start the search for their forever home in the Seattle area, and if you don’t believe us, just look at their faces for proof! Simba and Zaria arrived at our rescue after their family couldn’t keep them due to moving, but these two still maintain twice the upbeat attitude despite it all. Fans of friendly, spunky, outgoing dogs will get double the pleasure with these two, as they romp, play, and bounce around the room with their classic Boston Terrier energy! Simba and Zaria do everything in tandem and feed off of each other’s silly antics, which will leave you doubled over in laughter, and they can never seem to stop smiling! Cuddly and affectionate, this pair gets along fine with other dogs and would do beautifully in a home with humans ages 10 years old and older. If you have twice the room in your heart and home for a funny little pair of goofballs, Simba and Zaria may be the perfect fit for you!
        Simba and Zaria are fully vetted, spayed and neutered, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Simba and Zaria!</p>

        <p>Say hello to Slurpee, one of our new rescue arrivals! At only 4 years old, Slurpee spent the first part of his life at a breeder and is very happy to get the search underway for his forever home! Slurpee has had some experiences in his past that cause him to be very fearful of new people and situations, so a slow approach is the name of the game when it comes to winning his sweet little heart. Slurpee can be vocal when he is distressed so he would do best in a house rather than an apartment or condo. Because he is so easily frightened, he would prefer a home with adults only. Slurpee gets along for the most part with other dogs his size, yet can be a bit possessive of laps that he loves – however, this smart little boy takes correction well and would benefit from training to increase his bravery and trust with people and dogs alike! Once you have won Slurpee over, a full diet of cuddles, kisses and tail wags is on the menu with a side of loyalty and love to match. If you have the patience and understanding to help a boy like Slurpee be the best boy he can be, Slurpee would love to meet you!
        Slurpee is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. Please call Emerald City Pet Rescue at 206-557-4661 for more information on Slurpee!</p>

        <p>Meet Snowflake! 4 year old Snowflake came all the way from Soi Dogs in Thailand to join the ECPR family! Cute, independent Snowflake likes to be cuddled and would love to be a family’s one-and-only until she feels safe and secure. Great on walks and great with handling, Snowflake would likely benefit from crate training to keep her safe from harm when left at home alone. Because of her smarts, Snowflake can be precocious, so she demands a job and / or lots of physical and mental activity to keep her from being destructive (toys and chewy treats would help). Like her Soi Dog mates, Snowflake can be vocal and could escape if given the chance, so a house with a fenced-in yard is a must for her safety (no apartments or condos, please). Among Snowflake’s other requirements are no cats or kids under 12 years old in the home, and an experienced adopter who will show her the ropes through mandatory training which she is more than game for. Lastly, Snowflake has lost her vision in her right eye, and there is a slight possibility that down the road, she may lose sight in her other eye, so experience with blind dogs or special needs pets is a bonus. Can you open your heart and home to this beautiful girl?
        Snowflake is fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped. Please contact Emerald City Pet rescue for more information about Snowflake: 206.557.4661.</p>

      <p>Meet Snowflake, a five-year-old terrier mix. Snowflake is a sweet, gentle and sophisticated lady who is finally looking for her forever home. She loves to be with her people and her walks are the highlight of her day. She has learned lots of manners and tricks while in foster and comes with a long resume of commands (she's already house trained!). She loves to play fetch and tug, zoom through the yard with her stuffies, and especially loves to snuggle up with her people on these cold fall days (or anytime really)! Her foster dad says, "She plays like a puppy and snoozes like a senior".
      Snowflake ended up at the shelter by no fault of her own. She was rescued from a bad situation and had to wait in the shelter's foster care until the courts awarded her to us for adoption. While Snowflake's foster parents have done an amazing job of helping those wounds heal, she can occasionally be unsure of new people, dogs or situations. Her trust is earned over time. She's a sensitive girl, responds to the lightest of tones, and is eager to learn. Her ideal home would continue to be a safe, gentle environment that enjoys leisurely walks and a bit of a couch-potato lifestyle. Right now, she would love to be your one-and-only pet, and given her past, we think she deserves all your love, attention and snuggles.</p>

These two 10 year old Chihuahua mix gals are raring to go, eager to start the search for their forever home in the Seattle area. Sophy came to our rescue with “cherry eye” in both eyes, but she is wiggling with excitement to have them removed soon! Tippy has been a great help to Sophy through all of the changes they’ve experienced, and the comfort they provide each other in this bonded pair has made all the difference. Sophy and Tippy are both friendly, sweet, affectionate ladies whose tails rarely stop wagging! Tippy especially likes to give kisses to her human friends, while Sophy likes to talk… and talk… and talk… which is why they would be best suited for a house rather than an apartment or condo. While Tippy is climbing into your lap for a cuddle, Sophy can be found conquering all of the plushy toys in the room, as the girls seem equally devoted to making people smile! Sophy and Tippy would do best in a home with respectful children 14 years old and older, and in exchange for giving them the love and attention they deserve, they promise to return all that and more for many years to come!
        Sophy and Tippy are fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Sophy and Tippy!</p>

When Sprocket's family developed allergies that prevented him from staying in the home, Sprocket found his way to us and has been charming everyone he has met at our rescue ever since! Sprocket is very near perfection – he is whip smart, knows many commands, is incredibly affectionate and friendly, and gets along beautifully with other dogs of all sizes and young children, too! The only thing Sprocket loves more than fitting three tennis balls in his mouth or romping at the dog park is the cuddle time he shares with his humans. This gentle boy is a wonderful combination of active and mellow, and he would be well-suited for either a family with children, or as some lucky bachelor or bachelorette’s wingman. Sprocket the giant lap dog has a list of amazing qualities as giant as he is – but don’t take our word for it, take a chance on Sprocket and see for yourself - you won’t be disappointed!
        Sprocket is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Sprocket!</p>

        <p>Meet Thelma! This 7 years young Shepherd mix lady came all the way from Soi Dogs in Thailand to join the ECPR family! Thelma is super smart as well as treat motivated. She learns very quickly. Thelma is goofy and sweet, and while she gets along well with a lot of dogs, she would thrive in a home with individualized attention where required training with an experienced adopter would help her to grow in her obedience, manners, and trust (particularly with food guarding, her biggest area for improvement). Because she can be vocal and likes to bolt, a house with a fenced yard is the name of the game for Thelma – so no apartments or condos, please. Thelma enjoys playing with most people, yet requires a home without children under 12 years old and a highly active family is a must to keep her healthy and happy. Thelma LOVES water, so Thelma is hoping to meet a family that loves water as much as she does…like someone who would put a kiddie pool in the yard for her to splash and play in on warm days! Thelma is not a fan of cats (maybe because they don’t like water as much as she does!) so a cat-free home is a must. Raise your water-wings if you think you would be a great match for Thelma!Thelma is fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped.

Toby is a total trainer favorite and comes equipped with basic commands to start, in part because he is such a people pleaser! This beautiful brindle boy is known for having a gentle, easygoing disposition and being extremely affectionate with his humans. Toby is a delight to take on walks (though he could use help with pulling due to his large size), and enjoys playing fetch with a ball, going on hikes, and making people smile! Don’t let Toby’s ability to keep up with an active person fool you, though – while he enjoys the activity, he is also just as happy to join you for a Netflix binge on the couch because he can be a very mellow fellow. If you’re looking for loyalty and love in a size large, look no further than our boy, Toby! Toby is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped.

        <p>Welcome Walter! This 6 year old Terrier mix looking for a special home in the Seattle area. Walter displays shyness and some fear around new people and situations, yet with a patient and understanding person to show him the ropes and support him in his progress, Walter has shown an immense capacity for loyalty and love. Due to his need for behavioral rehabilitation, Walter would thrive best as the only dog in a house (no apartments or condos) without children. Walter has had surgery for IVDD, and while he can stand on all four legs, he is limited in mobility and has partial control of his bladder and bowels. A good way to win Walter’s heart is through treats, which he loves – almost as much as he enjoys walks, where Walter becomes a confident, friendly boy to people passing by! After medical complications and heartbreak after losing his previous home, we hope to find Walter the experienced, patient, understanding, supportive person who will help him to grow his confidence and provide him the love he deserves.

      <p>Hello my name is Eleanor I am a very friendly 12 year old Shih Tzu/ Poodle mix, who is currently searching for a warm home and a comfy lap where I can get all the love and cuddles that I deserve. I came to the shelter with really bad teeth, but the staff here took care of all of that. I also have chronic dry eye and will need life long medication for that. I would love to get to know you, so please come visit me a AVHS!</p>

      <p>Meet Miss Honeybee! She is the funniest lady.....she is a mini purebred 11 year old shar pei, 30lbs....she was originally found a stray in Los Angeles in an overcrowded shelter, so we got this darling little ole lady up here to Seattle and give her a chance.
      We immediately got her into the vet and found she is deaf and blind....BUT not permanently!!! Her loss of sight is caused from dry eye being left untreated and since we have been treating the layers of pigment have been slowly going away and no signs of dry eye so they are healing!!! Paws are crossed for full vision!
      She gets along just fine and once she knows the layout just rarely bumps into things, she always knows when it is breakfast and dinner time and makes it known if you are not punctual! She is full of life and personality. She is healthy otherwise and gets around just fine. She so deserves to finish living out her life in a healthy loving environment. She does great taking her eye drops which she will need the rest of her life.
      She does great with other dogs unless they try to sleep with her..she is so funny ...she even uses the doggie door! Loves being outside....finds things to scratch her back with and just plain knows what she wants in life! It only takes her a minute when a stranger walks in the door...the only time she barks to let us know....in case we couldn't see them!! Because she is a senior she also puts in for her naps!
      Please contact Kelly at K9WRINKLES@AOL.COM if you are interested in adopting or fostering. You will not find Honeybee or any of the MEOW dogs at the cat shelter...all MEOW dogs are in foster homes. Thank you for looking to adopt not shop!</p>

      <p>Lady had several small mammary masses removed (breast cancer). These masses were small, but there is a chance they could come back or develop in other locations. Interested adopters should plan to monitor her regularly for these. We also suspect Lady has arthritis. She does very well with arthritis medication and should continue lifelong treatment to keep her comfortable in her golden years.</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/elderly/lucylynn.jpg"/>
      <p>Say hello to little Lucy Lynn, one of our new rescue arrivals! This 8 year old Pomeranian lady is looking forward to finding her new forever home in the Seattle area. Lucy Lynn came to our rescue after her owner passed away and she had no one to care for her. Since then, Lucy Lynn has been visibly saddened by the loss and major change to her life, but has been making great strides in our care as we dote on her with cuddles, attention, and affection! Lucy Lynn is a very sweet girl who loves to be on laps or stretched out on her back for afternoon naps, but she has quite the spry side, too! Lucy Lynn is easy on the eyes for certain, but you cannot imagine how cute she is when she romps with you and chases you around the room playfully. When Lucy Lynn is having a lot of fun, she will go into an adorable play bow and make the funniest little sounds! We haven’t found Lucy Lynn’s favorite treat yet, but she adores the company of people (ladies especially) and would make a wonderful companion for anyone seeking a fluffy little lap dog friend. Lucy Lynn would do best as the only dog in the home and would be just fine with respectful kids 12 years old and older. Lucy Lynn can be vocal at times, so no apartments or condos for this gal. While this chapter in her life may be a sad one, Lucy Lynn hopes that you can help her write the happy ending!
      Lucy Lynn is fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Lucy Lynn!</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/elderly/pinky.jpg"/>
      <p>Meet Pinky! Pinky is a delightful 10 year old Chihuahua looking for a warm home in the Seattle area with lots of soft blankets to burrow into! Pinky was rescued from a shelter in California, so her story is mostly unknown. What we do know is she loves to snuggle, be carried around, and delights in a warm lap. While Pinky does get along with most other dogs, she isn't looking for a playmate. Pinky is a shy little lady and needs time to warm up to new people. She would do best in a quiet, relaxed home where she can build up her confidence and settle in. Are you looking for a TV buddy? Pinky might just be your girl!
      Pinky is fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped. Please call Emerald City Pet Rescue at 206-557-4661 to meet Pinky.</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/elderly/ross.jpg"/>
      <p>This lil man is a mini cream shar pei....that is in need of someone who will finally actually care for him and about him...he is nothing but love even though he has been horrible neglected over the years.
      Ross is a true gentleman, he loves dogs, people, cars, dog beds and snuggling. He lets you cut his nails, clean his ears medicate his eye.....yes, he only has one eye left...he has glaucoma and the pressure in the one eye got so high that the vessels popped so he only has one functioning eye left, it also has glaucoma but the pressures are not extreme and the eye meds will keep it down. He does also have a typical shar pei yeast infection in his ears also being treated and treatment is working!
      We assume he is around 8 years of age....and hoping some big heart would love to care for Ross and show him how life should really be!!! Please contact Kelly at K9WRINKLES@AOL.COM Thank you for looking to adopt not shop!</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/elderly/tbone.jpg"/>
      <p>T-bone is a sweet senior Shar Pei with plenty of love left to give. He adores getting attention and his tail is always wagging but he is also content to be on his own. If given the choice he would rather be outside than in so the ideal situation for him would be a fenced yard with a covered area where he could just hang out in his bed regardless of the weather. He actually prefers to sleep outside but that would be a problem in the winter. He currently has hip issues so a home without stairs would be preferred. He has problems making it thru a dog door but he'll let you know when he needs to go outside.
      He is very gentle with children but has issues with small dogs and cats so that would not be an option. He is good with older dogs but his mobility issues sometimes makes it hard for him to get out of the way which some dogs react to as aggression.
      Everyone who has met T-bone instantly falls in love with him. We hope you will too. Poor T Bone only got turned into the shelter as his owner passed away....not his fault!
      T BONE IS NOT AT THE SHELTER...ALL MEOW DOGS ARE IN FOSTER HOMES!! PLEASE EMAIL KELLY AT K9WRINKLES@AOL.COM AND SHE WILL EMAIL AN APPLICATION.</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/puppy/Nate.jpg"/>
      <p>Hey, I'm Nate! At ten months old I'm just a big puppy who's very energetic, athletic and exuberant! I arrived at the shelter as a stray, and I'm really looking forward to having a family and home of my very own.
      While I haven't had much training, I'm a smart guy, and already I've learned to sit politely when offered a tasty treat. I'm super food motivated, and am sure to be a star in manners class. In case you didn't notice, I'm one handsome dude! My coat is sleek and shiny and my eyes twinkle with glee.
      Stuff I'd probably be great at - agility, fly ball, hiking and jogging, swimming and fetch! My ideal home will be as active and athletic as me, and have some prior dog experience. I'm good with kids age ten and up, and, I really prefer humans to other dogs. Let's meet! </p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/puppy/Poli.jpg"/>
      <p>Poli is a special puppy that is in need of a home that understands her. She is frightened of new situations and people. Her reaction is to bark, growl and sometimes nip. She really wants a lap to sleep on and a family to love her. Right now Poli will need an adult only home until she goes through training and learns to trust. She does like other dogs her size but will be too scared of large dogs.</p>

      <p>This tiny little pup Wenatchee has been in foster care his entire life getting lots of love and socialization. His mom weighs about 17lbs so he will likely be around the same size or smaller. We don't know what breed he is but we are guessing they are Chihuahua/Terrier mixes.</p>

      <p>Hi, my name is Faux Pas! I am very nervous and don't like fast, darting movements towards me. I will come to you if you are patient and let me check you out, I will reward you with kisses. I love my walks with the AVHS volunteers, they say I love to run in the back yard and jump when I'm out walking. If you would like to meet me, please ask the front desk staff for assistance.</p>
