      <p>Hi there! My name is Alberta, and I'm a recent Seattle transplant looking for my forever home. I've had a bit of a rough start to life, but I arrived here thanks to Wings of Rescue, and I'm ready to write my story anew. I'm a quiet, calm girl and I'm pretty shy but I LOVE toys, especially the squeaky kind. I can live with dog and cat siblings who will respect my space, but I'm fine being an only dog as well. I could be the perfect apartment or condo dog as my previous owner trained me to use puppy pads.
      I'm looking for a quiet home with humans who have previous shy dog experience who are ready to work with me to help me come out of my shell. It will definitely take me some time to get to know you, but I think it will be super rewarding. Will you be my person? Apply to meet me today!

      <p>Baby is a sweet girl that is excited about life and meeting new people. She has lived around kids before but she can be a little excited so you will need to watch her and make sure she knows not to play too rough. She does not appreciate the antics of other canines and will need a feline free home. Medical info; Baby has a torn cruciate that may or may not require surgery in the future.</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Bo.jpg"/>
      <p>Bo is sweet little guy that is looking for a home that can give him lots of attention! He has lived with respectful kids over 7 years old. He has lived with other dogs but will sometimes bark when first meeting them. He should have a meet and greet with any resident canines prior to adoption. He knows a ton of commands and loves to cuddle! </p>

      <img class="middle-img" src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Chewy.jpg"/>
      <p>Chewy is a big lovable goof looking for his new home. Chewy needs to be the only pet in the home as he loves to be the center of attention and doesn't get along with other animals in the home. He loves car rides and going to groomers! He likes to play tug o war and chase balls. He knows lots of commands and loves to slobber all over everyone! Chewy has separation anxiety so he will need a home with someone who is around most of the time. He cannot be crated as well. He loves to chew and will need plenty of toys! Chewy likes to jump on people and can topple over little kids there for anyone in the home should be over 7. Chewy also gets overly excited with tennis balls and can swallow them so we don't recommend any.</p>

       <img src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Chloe.jpg"/>
      <p>Hello! I'm Chloe and I am so ready to find my forever home. My life before coming into the shelter wasn't the happiest so it was really hard for me to trust humans, but since going into my foster home I have learned to love and fully trust my foster parents. With slow and consistent introductions I've learned to let a few other people into my inner circle of trust as well and I can't wait to meet someone willing to be patient with me so I can spend the rest of my days with them, snuggling under the covers! I'm already house trained, so no worries there!
      A yard would be nice but I LOVE going on walks and using my nose every day. I love meeting people and dogs on my walks. I'd be fine as a single dog so I could get all of your love and attention but I think I'd like a doggy playmate as well, as long as they're easy going and are good at communicating. No human children or cats, please; children are too unpredictable and cats are just too fun to chase.
      The humans want my forever family to have experience with herding/high drive breeds since I can be nervous in new situations and have a moderate amount of energy, and my new home will need to be a pretty relaxed place without lots of comings and goings while I get acclimated. If you're looking for a devoted, goofy, super snuggly best friend look no farther!</p>

      <p> Miss Cupcake to you!! This sweet lady is shy when she first meets new friends but once comfortable she loves attention and a warm lap to snuggle on. Cupcake is looking for her new family who will love and adore her and is better suited in a quiet, predictable home with adults only where she can gain some confidence.</p>

      <img class="middle-img" src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Flo.jpg"/>
      <p>Just go with the.. Flo! Jedi is here with his sister Flo, and they are looking for a loving home they can share. This sweet duo has spent their whole lives in a shelter, and are so ready to finally have a home to call their own! Jedi and Flo like to take life easy, love nap time, and make great cuddle buddies! They get along with other friendly and polite dogs, but as long as they have each other they are happy. They are looking for an easy going home where they can relax and take life at their own pace. Jedi and Flo are best suited with respectful children who can understand that this lovely pair can be a bit bashful at times. If your home (and heart!) is big enough to welcome this dynamic duo, come by and meet them today!</p>

      <img class="middle-img" src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Frida.jpg"/>
      <p>I'm Frida, aka "Frito!" At 7 pounds and 2 years of age, I'm a sprightly, playful Chihuahua/Italian Greyhound Mix. I'm all legs, eyes and ears! I actually have only 3 legs now, as one was recently amputated, but this does not slow me down! I love to play fetch and can run FAST. I throw my toys around, and would love to live with a compatible, playful dog (not too rough!) I keep trying to get the senior dog in my foster home to play, but she's not taking the bait, despite my frequent asks. I will keep trying....
      I need a knowledgeable family who's truly dedicated to the task of completing my house training, and I want a fun, active home, but as I startle easily, young kids are not appropriate for me./p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Jade.jpg"/>
      <p>Jade is a shy little dog who has been passed around a bit. Once she warms up she wants to be your best friend. She has done ok with other dogs her size here but we are unsure how she will be with cats. Any children in the home should be over the age of 12 years and respectful of small shy dogs.</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Jake.jpg"/>
      <p>Jake is a sweet guy who has a problem with livestock. From rabbits to alpacas Jake does not do well with them and CANNOT live with any small critters or farm animals. His previous owners said he did ok with other dogs and cats. He knows a lot of commands and does well with clicker training. Jake did well with older kids because of his energy level, He loves to play chase but he's not so good at bringing it back. He would make a great family dog for adopters with knowledge about his breed. His only other bad habit is he digs holes and chases cars. Jake is not suited for an apartment and needs a fenced, secure yard.</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Lion.jpg"/>
      <p>Lion is a cute and lovable boy. He will thrive in a semi-active, pet savvy, mature home where he can be your one and only 4-legged companion. Lion is very affectionate and would make a GREAT companion dog. He loves to sit with you while your reading the paper, working, or just hanging out. But during bedtime, he prefers to be alone on his own bed - Lion needs beauty sleep! He is very playful and he will flourish in a home where he will get lots of opportunities to play, go for walks and frolic. Lion will benefit from training. He is eager to please, so he should be a good student. This wonderful fellow is an absolute sweetheart, and I'm not "lion". Come meet him and see for yourself.</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Luna.jpg"/>
      <p>Miss Luna is such a pretty girl! She has a fun and bouncy nature, and loves to have a good time. Since Miss Luna does have a bouncy playstyle, she may be best suited with kids 12 and older who can keep up with her. She loves to jump up and gives kisses, and is just so sweet and snuggly. Miss Luna enjoys the company of other dogs, but does prefer a more easy going male to be her buddy. Come by and meet this lovely lady today!</p>

    <a href="adoption.html" ><div class="imgContainer">
      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Midnight.jpg"/>
      <p>Midnight is a handsome active lab ready for a new home. He will need plenty of exercise and training. Midnight came to us as a stray so we don't know too much about him. His new home should not have any cats or other dogs. He really has not done well with other canines here. Any kids in the home should be dog savvy and over 7 years old. He is very smart and tends to look for an escape route when left alone outside. Midnight needs a home where he can run and play so apartments aren't a good fit. Midnight is not a dog who can go to the dog park or other events where other dogs will be around.</p>

      <p>Hey, everybody! My name is Milo, and I'd love to meet you! I'm a friendly, happy, energetic little guy of 4, with a big personality and an irresistible underbite. You can probably tell from the photos that I'm a bit talkative, but I'm also more than ready to settle in for belly rubs and snuggles. Despite my exuberance, I'm actually quite calm... nothing bothers me, whether it's loud noises or people. I LOVE people! Hooray! Come pay me a visit and let's see if we're made for each other.</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Reggie.jpg"/>
      <p>Meet Reggie! This wonderful boy is looking for an active home to join. He loves to jump and run and play and would appreciate a home that can help him get out his energy in a positive way. Reggie would do best in a home with kids over the age of 12, and no apartments please. Reggie can play nicely with the right dog, but wouldn't mind being the only canine in the home so he can be the center of attention. He is a super smart boy who is eager to learn more! If you are looking for a running, biking, or hiking partner look no further than Reggie!</p>

    <a href="adoption.html" ><div class="imgContainer">
      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/adult/Snowflake.jpg"/>
      <p>Meet Snowflake, a five-year-old terrier mix. Snowflake is a sweet, gentle and sophisticated lady who is finally looking for her forever home. She loves to be with her people and her walks are the highlight of her day. She has learned lots of manners and tricks while in foster and comes with a long resume of commands (she's already house trained!). She loves to play fetch and tug, zoom through the yard with her stuffies, and especially loves to snuggle up with her people on these cold fall days (or anytime really)! Her foster dad says, "She plays like a puppy and snoozes like a senior".
      Snowflake ended up at the shelter by no fault of her own. She was rescued from a bad situation and had to wait in the shelter's foster care until the courts awarded her to us for adoption. While Snowflake's foster parents have done an amazing job of helping those wounds heal, she can occasionally be unsure of new people, dogs or situations. Her trust is earned over time. She's a sensitive girl, responds to the lightest of tones, and is eager to learn. Her ideal home would continue to be a safe, gentle environment that enjoys leisurely walks and a bit of a couch-potato lifestyle. Right now, she would love to be your one-and-only pet, and given her past, we think she deserves all your love, attention and snuggles.</p>

    <a href="adoption.html" ><div class="imgContainer">
      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/elderly/Brandi.jpg"/>
      <p>Brandi's owner recently passed away and she is looking for a new home. She is a very nice little dog and would love a home with an older couple or person. She has done ok with other small breed dogs here but we are unsure about cats. Come meet this lovely lady today.</p>

    <a href="adoption.html" ><div class="imgContainer">
      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/puppy/Nate.jpg"/>
      <p>Hey, I'm Nate! At ten months old I'm just a big puppy who's very energetic, athletic and exuberant! I arrived at the shelter as a stray, and I'm really looking forward to having a family and home of my very own.
      While I haven't had much training, I'm a smart guy, and already I've learned to sit politely when offered a tasty treat. I'm super food motivated, and am sure to be a star in manners class. In case you didn't notice, I'm one handsome dude! My coat is sleek and shiny and my eyes twinkle with glee.
      Stuff I'd probably be great at - agility, fly ball, hiking and jogging, swimming and fetch! My ideal home will be as active and athletic as me, and have some prior dog experience. I'm good with kids age ten and up, and, I really prefer humans to other dogs. Let's meet! </p>

    <a href="adoption.html" ><div class="imgContainer">
      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/puppy/Poli.jpg"/>
      <p>Poli is a special puppy that is in need of a home that understands her. She is frightened of new situations and people. Her reaction is to bark, growl and sometimes nip. She really wants a lap to sleep on and a family to love her. Right now Poli will need an adult only home until she goes through training and learns to trust. She does like other dogs her size but will be too scared of large dogs.</p>
      </div>
    <a href="adoption.html" ><div class="imgContainer">
      <img src="animal_pics/dogs/puppy/Wenatchee.jpg"/>
      <p>This tiny little pup Wenatchee has been in foster care his entire life getting lots of love and socialization. His mom weighs about 17lbs so he will likely be around the same size or smaller. We don't know what breed he is but we are guessing they are Chihuahua/Terrier mixes.</p>
