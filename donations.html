  <h1>Help Save Lives!</h1>
  <p id="help">Making a donation to any Seattle area animal shelter is one of the simplest ways you can save a life and prevent pet homelessness. Want to help but don't have or want to give money? Most shelters need supplies, volunteers, or people to foster animals. Here is a list of local shelters in the Seattle area. Click on any picture and it will take you directly to their site.</p>

<p>Emerald City Pet Rescue exists to rescue abused, neglected and homeless animals. We pull predominantly from high-kill shelters around the country and place them into loving forever homes. Sometimes these animals come from abroad and sometimes from right around the corner. Emerald City Pet Rescue is run by dedicated staff and volunteers who give their time and resources to house, train, rehabilitate, transport and care for these animals.</p>
