      <h2>Alberta</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Hi there! My name is Alberta, and I'm a recent Seattle transplant looking for my forever home. I've had a bit of a rough start to life, but I arrived here thanks to Wings of Rescue, and I'm ready to write my story anew. I'm a quiet, calm girl and I'm pretty shy but I LOVE toys, especially the squeaky kind. I can live with dog and cat siblings who will respect my space, but I'm fine being an only dog as well. I could be the perfect apartment or condo dog as my previous owner trained me to use puppy pads.</p><p>
      I'm looking for a quiet home with humans who have previous shy dog experience who are ready to work with me to help me come out of my shell. It will definitely take me some time to get to know you, but I think it will be super rewarding. Will you be my person? Apply to meet me today!

She has lived around kids before but she can be a little excited so you will need to watch her and make sure she knows not to play too rough. She does not appreciate the antics of other canines and will need a feline free home. Medical info; Baby has a torn cruciate that may or may not require surgery in the future.</p></div>

      <p>My name is Bailey and I am available for adoption at the RASKC Pet Adoption Center in Kent.I was brought in by my previous owner on 3/25/17 because I don't like other dogs. I lived in a home with older children. My previous owner described me as playful.My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!I am a very smart dog! I have shown my caregivers that I already know how to "sit", "stay", "come", "down" and "shake".I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs. I may do best as the only dog in my new home, or need to meet other dogs in the home first.When I get nervous I may show my teeth, but don't worry I am actually smiling. When I am scared I smile to be submissive.

      <p>Meet Capone, one of our new rescue arrivals! Capone is looking forward to starting the search for his forever home in the Seattle area. When it comes to handsome, this four year old Pekingese mix boy could put any runway model to shame! With his adorable face and underbite, Capone’s got himself quite a cute mug and a whole lot more to offer to just the right person. Although Capone has made some human friends, he can be a touch fearful at first with new people. With respect, a gentle touch and plenty of treats to reward his progress, Capone will show you his friendly, affectionate side! Before long, you can expect to enjoy plenty of cuddles and snuggles, complete with belly rubs and a tail that won’t stop wagging! Capone does not like his kennel, and will grumble to tell you all about it, so he would do best not being crated or kenneled while left alone at home. Because of Capone’s initial fear, he would thrive best in a home with respectful humans 12 years and older. And, treats of all kinds are more than welcome and encouraged!
      </p><p>Capone is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Capone!</p></div>

      <p>Please give a warm welcome to Cha Cha, one of our new rescue arrivals! This tiny little 10 year old Chihuahua cutie pie comes all the way from California, and she can’t wait to start the search for her forever home in the Seattle area. Sweet little Cha Cha is as adorable as she is itty bitty, which is to say, very much so! Cha Cha may be small in stature, but don’t let that fool you – underneath her gentle, delicate demeanor lies a confident little gal who can be choosy with her doggie friends and communicates very well with them. Along with sniffing and exploring, Cha Cha counts among her favorite things cuddles, snuggles, lap sessions, kisses, closeness, and butt scratches! Cha Cha is such a mellow, gentle little girl that she would make a great fit for a first time dog owner, but would prefer a home with humans ages 14 years old and older. If small, sweet and snuggly is on your list, Cha Cha may just have your number!

      <h2>Becky</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Becky is an adult cat overflowing with kittenish charms. A diminutive, six-pound bundle of enthusiasm, Becky will bound after you from room to room, chirping happily at frequencies conducive to echolocation. Expect enormous green eyes to meet your own when you open kitchen cabinets; Becky is an intrepid explorer undaunted by heights. Her athletic prowess belies every one of her nine years. A playful presence, Becky is often on the move, patrolling her territory and stalking catnip mice. (Although the hunt usually ends with Becky sprawled across the floor, belly to the sky.)</p><p>
      Becky is as cuddlesome as she is playful. She loves to be scratched under the chin and will express her approbation in a purr loud enough to set her tiny frame quivering. She loves to sleep on the bed (and on its occupant.) Becky can never get enough of human attention; she's also fine with other cats and children.</p></div>

      <h2>Bob</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Hi, my name is Bob and I love attention! Don't let my tipped ear and rugged good looks fool you; I am a very gentle and affectionate boy who loves being petted and sitting on laps.
      My personality type has been described as a SECRET ADMIRER, and here's what that means:
      When it comes to relationships, I'm very level-headed. I don't leap in paws first, if you know what I mean. But give me a little time, and then I'll shower you with purrs, head-butts, and plenty of lap time. In the meantime, you may not see a lot of me - but I'll be thinking a lot of you.</p><p>
      This wonderful cat has tested positive for FIV. What exactly does that mean? FIV is a cat-only disease and cannot be passed on to humans or other non-felines. It is highly unlikely that an altered, FIV+ cat would spread the disease to other cats in the home - it is only transmitted through blood, and would require a very serious, deep bite wound to do so. This disease predominantly hits unaltered roaming tomcats, fighting to defend their territory.</p><p>
      FIV is a disease of the immune system, and for this reason an FIV+ cat must live indoors only. The good news is that the majority of these cats live long, happy, relatively normal lives with no symptoms at all. Please consider opening up your heart and your home to this deserving cat. Be sure to speak with the shelter officers if you have further questions. Thank you!</p></div>

      <p>Meet Chewey! This handsome 4-year old Chihuahua mix boy is excited to start the search for his forever home. After receiving surgery for a ruptured disc, Chewey has been using a wheelchair, but is regaining the use of his back legs and becoming less dependant on his wheelchair to get around! With continued physical therapy, Chewey may be able to ditch his wheels completely one day! Charismatic, friendly, and very sweet, Chewey tolerates other dogs, but would be happiest as the only dog in the home so he has plenty of room for his big personality to shine. Chewey does not get along well with cats.

      <h2>Chewy</h2><div class="description">
      <p>Chewy is a big lovable goof looking for his new home. Chewy needs to be the only pet in the home as he loves to be the center of attention and doesn't get along with other animals in the home. He loves car rides and going to groomers! He likes to play tug o war and chase balls. He knows lots of commands and loves to slobber all over everyone! Chewy has separation anxiety so he will need a home with someone who is around most of the time. He cannot be crated as well. He loves to chew and will need plenty of toys! Chewy likes to jump on people and can topple over little kids there for anyone in the home should be over 7. Chewy also gets overly excited with tennis balls and can swallow them so we don't recommend any.</p></div>

      <div class="description">
      <p>Hello! I'm Chloe and I am so ready to find my forever home. My life before coming into the shelter wasn't the happiest so it was really hard for me to trust humans, but since going into my foster home I have learned to love and fully trust my foster parents. With slow and consistent introductions I've learned to let a few other people into my inner circle of trust as well and I can't wait to meet someone willing to be patient with me so I can spend the rest of my days with them, snuggling under the covers! I'm already house trained, so no worries there!
      </p><p>
      A yard would be nice but I LOVE going on walks and using my nose every day. I love meeting people and dogs on my walks. I'd be fine as a single dog so I could get all of your love and attention but I think I'd like a doggy playmate as well, as long as they're easy going and are good at communicating. No human children or cats, please; children are too unpredictable and cats are just too fun to chase.
      </p><p>
      The humans want my forever family to have experience with herding/high drive breeds since I can be nervous in new situations and have a moderate amount of energy, and my new home will need to be a pretty relaxed place without lots of comings and goings while I get acclimated. If you're looking for a devoted, goofy, super snuggly best friend look no farther!</p></div>

      <h2>CeCe</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>CeCe is a tender-hearted soul who will reward you with love once you've gained her trust. Her past circumstances didn't allow her the calm atmosphere or unencumbered space she enjoys, and now she's looking for a home with a more patient and loving family. Her shy nature doesn't mean she'll spend all of her time exploring remote areas of the house though. CeCe loves cheek rubs, belly scratches, and being brushed. Once she learns to trust in your steady and caring presence, she'll begin seeking you out.</p><p>
      Because of her disposition, CeCe is on a daily dose of anti-anxiety medication that is easily crushed and mixed into her food. She takes her medicine easily and loves you most when you put out a bowl of food for her to eat. If you give CeCe some love and chat with her about your day, she'll enjoy talking back to you with a sweet little meow. Sometimes you may hear her give a half-hearted hiss, but that's only when she's startled; after that immediate reaction she will shortly return to the sweet cat you know and love. Toys and treats definitely help her warm up to you, and it doesn't hurt if you have a toasty warm sunspot in your house either.</p><p>
      CeCe would do best with a mature owner who has previous cat experience and can let her flourish as the only animal in the house. CeCe has good litter box habits and is easily able to entertain herself during the day. But don't stay away too long, because she'll want you back to play with her string toy. Be bold and give a call to see if CeCe could be the perfect match for you!</p></div>

      <p>Say hello to Cinnamon, one of our adoptable rescue pets! At two years young, this Chiweenie cutie pie is excited to start the search for a forever home of her own. Cinnamon has had some experiences in her past that have caused her to be reactive and fearful in certain situations, so Cinnamon would benefit most from an experienced adopter who can give her the guidance and training she needs to build her confidence. After all that she has been through, Cinnamon hopes to find someone to give her a chance and support her through her progress and setbacks, because she truly wants to trust and love humans. Cinnamon is a great communicator and always lets you know when she’s feeling happy and brave, or when she feels insecure and frightened, and in time you will see her great capacity for love and affection! When Cinnamon trusts you, she lets her guard down and reveals her cuddly, snuggly, sweet side. Due to her fear, Cinnamon hopes to find a forever home without any children. However, a home with cats and other dogs are no problem at all, especially if you can keep the treats and cuddles coming her way!

      Cinnamon is fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped. For more information or to meet Cinnamon, please contact Emerald City Pet Rescue at 206-557-4661</p></div>

      <p>Please give a warm welcome to Deena, one of our new rescue arrivals! This 4 year old Yorkie mix gal is looking forward to finding her forever home in the Seattle area. While Deena’s past may be a mystery, there is no question that this girl has a great capacity for love when it comes to humans! This super sweet little lady may be a bit shy at first meeting, but warms up with a patient approach and respectful handling. Darling Deena especially enjoys the company of women and gives kisses and cuddles easily once you have her trust! Deena also has a playful side which will have you in stitches as she makes the funniest little grumbles and growls while playing with you. Due to her initial shyness and distaste for slip leads, Deena would thrive in a home with other dogs, and respectful humans ages 14 years and up. For a lovely combination of affection, playfulness, loyalty, and spunk, look no further than our doll, Deena!

      She wants a home that will treat her as a family member and love her forever. She is about 12 yrs old. In her first home she was very kind and patient with the child of the family, who was about 3 years old. In her second home, she got along with the human residents. She didn't get the medical attention she needed and her kidney disease progressed. She had two homes already, but for one reason or another she ended up back to the rescue. Not her fault, other than needing a little extra care. Because of her kidney disease, she needs sub Q fluids, which she accepts easily. She has a special diet that she gets her medicine in. This is the sweetest cat in the whole world. She would like a home to live in as well as people to love her and take care of her. She is social, talkative and a complete charmer.

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/adult/Opal.jpg"/>
      <h2>Opal</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>OPAL was brought to SAS in late November, along with 2 or 3 other cats. Her ‘sad eyes' look seems to mirror a short indoor/outdoor lifestyle, without much care from her former humans. She was in poor condition and very pregnant, ready to deliver kittens at time of surrender.
      She was taken into a foster home and her overall condition has improved considerably since that time.
      Her age is unknown but her behavior and activity level is that of a very young cat, possibly 1 or 2 years old.
      A little shy with strangers, she is receptive to kindness and attention from people. As a pretty, flame point Siamese cat, her talkative nature seems to fit the traits of her breed. Her routine chatter is easily distinguished from a tone of distress when something upsets her.</p><p>
      Opal delivered five kittens the day after Thanksgiving and devoted her attention to them for nearly three months. Though not much is known about her former stay with prior owner, she did not like the other cats in the household. She has retained some wariness from earlier experiences, though she can be in same room with other cats, as long as they don't confront her. Based on that discomfort, she would probably do best in a quiet household with no other pets or small children. However, she continued to enjoy the company of her five kittens, even as they became very independent and more interactive with each other. Opal has been seen on many occasions chasing her very active kittens, playing with them and with favorite toys.</p><p>
      Four of her kittens are recently adopted or about to be adopted. That still leaves an opportunity for Opal to have a companion in a new home if she is adopted with her remaining daughter, Onyx (in the photos with her). They get along well with each other, are both playful, and receptive to human attention.
      Do you have a home to offer this sweet cat, and give her a chance for a better life in a loving home?
      If you are interested in meeting Opal and her kitten, Onyx, please contact Joan at wolfbird50@comcast.net</p>

When Kona isn’t kissing you or enjoying a cuddle, his tail wags endlessly as he tries to earn treats (one of his favorite things).

Lincoln is a sweet, well-socialized fella, who makes the funniest noises when he’s trying to communicate with you. Lincoln is very treat motivated and learns quickly, and is very good at communicating with other dogs, though he can be impatient with them from time to time, so Lincoln would prefer a home with either senior or mellow dogs (or, ideally, he could be the only dog in the home and hold the spotlight all on his own). Lincoln is looking for an active family that will take him on daily hikes and adventures where he can show off his amazing walking skills! Lincoln needs a cat-free home, and because he can be vocal, apartments and condos are not for him, either. Because of his past, Lincoln requires a home with a fenced yard to prevent him from escaping, must remain 100% on leash or tethered, and would prefer a home with people 12 years old and up. A lot of training will be required for Lincoln, so experienced adopters who can provide him with these opportunities are ideal for him. Are you the right match for this international super-dog?

This pretty tuxedo kitty is one of the most affectionate cats you'll ever meet. She loves cheek and chin rubs, curling up on laps, sleeping in the sun with her belly showing, and snuggling by her foster mom's shoulder so she can share the pillow. She also likes to sprawl with her legs in front of her to groom her tummy, sitting up like a person while she cares for herextra soft and velvety coat. She is a confident, chatty girl and a lively companion.</p><p>
      Eddie is mildly vision-impaired (although you wouldn't know it from looking at her beautiful green eyes) but she doesn't let it bother her at all and uses all her other senses to compensate for her poor eyesight. She is very vocal, purring constantly and talking to you in her unique voice. She loves to chase her bird toy and her rattling ball - both of these toys make noise so she can track them easily. She tends to play with all four paws on the ground, or rolling on her back, insteadof jumping. She uses her sense of touch too, sometimes gently tapping her person to communicate, especially at mealtime. She manages her vision impairment very well and her foster parent can share tips to help mitigate its impact on her life.</p><p>

When it comes to Lucy, it’s go, go, go – this active girl needs an active family to keep up with her on adventures like hikes, jogs, and plenty of walks around the neighborhood! However, Lucy’s energy is also tempered by a sweet, affectionate, and very obedient side, as she loves to make people smile by showing off her knowledge of basic commands. This lovely girl is so happy with people that she positively vibrates with joy when you meet her, and she loves to stick by your side and show her endless loyalty! Lucy’s idea of a perfect day is playing fetch with a ball, taking a jog or a hike, and then snuggling next to her human on the sofa with some treats on standby. Due to her strong prey drive for furry things smaller than her, she should ideally be the only dog in the home, but might be able to strike up a friendship with a dog her size or larger. When it comes to humans of all ages and sizes, Lucy is a big hit and would love to be the newest member of your family!
      </p><p>
      Lucy is fully vetted, spayed, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Lucy!</p></div>

      <h2>Katniss</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Katniss is an awesome feline! She's a master lap cat, a great snuggler and even intuitive - knowing when you've had a tough day and need her extra comfort. She's got a hearty, deep purr and will gaze at you intently with her expressive, green eyes. Katniss would love to greet your guests are the door, hang out on the back of your couch or even play with your existing feline friend!</p><p>
      In return, for her good natured and enviable cat personality, Katniss needs a little extra TLC from her adopter. She's got diabetes, but she's on a very low dose of insulin and takes her medicine without fuss. In return, she will be a very bonded companion to you and so happy to have a home to call her own!
      This warm and patient Katniss is good with kids who understand how to read a cat's signals. She'd do well in a moderately active home and would enjoy the company of a feline friend. Call the foster care hotline above to schedule a time to meet Katniss. </p>

      <div class="description">
      <p>Lillie is a fabulous, independent, (almost) 9-year old, delightful girl. We have had the awesome experience being her foster parents. She took her sweet time getting to know us, preferring to hang alone than with us. And we let her. Well, I have to admit, I tried to get to be her friend before she wanted me to. She's just SO cute looking, I couldn't resist! Lillie is a gray tabby with a thick black stripe along her spine and a darling white, tan and gray face. Her eyes are green andher paws are white.</p><p>
      Lillie has a funny personality and she will let you know when she wants to eat and when you need to clean her litter box (twice a day) and when she wants you to follow her somewhere (usually the kitchen for food) and when she wants you to pet her. Lillie is very vocal, so you'll know what she wants and when she wants it. She will definitely make you laugh. Lillie will not do well with other pets or commotion in a house. She would prefer a single person or couple without children. Otherthan all that, she is one perfect cat. She doesn't jump up on furniture or kitchen counters. She has perfect litter box habits.</p></div>

        <div class="description">
        <p>Lilyput is a sweet and gentle 12 year old girl. While being very independent, she loves a scratch behind her ears and under her chin. Lilyput enjoys human company and will gladly sit next to you while you watch TV or read a book. She loves a good catnip toy and will playfully roll around with it for hours. Lilyput is tolerant of other cats but would do best in a quiet home without small kids. One look into her big blue eyes and you will fall in love with Lilyput.</p><p>
        Being a 12 year old cat, Lilyput does have some kidney-related medical issues; therefore, she must be fed a kidney-care diet. She gladly eats this food and will let you know when she wants some more!</p><p>
        I'm happy to introduce you to Miss Panda. She was first adopted out from Seattle Animal Shelter when she was just a kitten. 12 years later she was returned by workers employed to remove trash from an apartment where she was found. Panda was neglected and distrustful when she first arrived back at SAS. When taken in as a foster she immediately flourished into an affectionate and joyful cat who quickly claimed a favorite window sill to watch the world go by and a favorite hiding place in the back of the closet to take a nap in private. But most of all she likes company and is quick to nestle near her favorite person in hopes of getting some attention. She enjoys her catnip toys and is a diligent user of her cat scratcher. She is also dependable on using the litter box.
        She often comes excitedly to the door to greet you when you arrive home. This seems to happen more when she is fed her preference, canned food</p>

      <p>Meet the sweet Marco! This 2 year-old Pit Bull mix boy is sweet, cuddly, and “Terrier brained” (i.e. short attention span). A great walker, this adorable little guy is very protective of his food and treats, so don’t plan on sharing with him until you’ve helped him refine his manners through training which would be a great benefit to Marco. Marco would love a home with an adopter who is experienced with his breed, and needs to be the only animal in the home. However, we are sure Marco has more than enough companionship, affection, and love to fill any home to capacity. We are unsure of how Marco does with children at this time.

      <p>Meet Matilda, one of our new rescue arrivals! This beautiful little 6 year old Chihuahua mix lady is excited to get the search underway for her forever home in the Seattle area. Matilda has a condition called “ataxia”, which causes her wobbly, uneven walking style. However, Matilda hasn’t let the condition dampen her sunny spirits and she still gets around just fine! Matilda is about as sweet as they come, with an affectionate disposition that comes through as she leans against you for petting sessions and follows you around the room like an adorable, fluffy little shadow! Miss Matilda is a gentle, snuggly soft girl who prefers the quiet life to a lot of adventure and excitement, and she would make a wonderful cuddle buddy or lap dog for a very lucky person. When Matilda isn’t curiously exploring the world around her, she can be found making friends with other dogs and earning her distinction of “kennel favorite” with ease! Because of Matilda’s condition, she would benefit most from a carpeted home with no big dogs and respectful children 14 years old and older.

      <p>Nadia is a spritely petite kitty who will wow you with her acrobatic skill. She likes to be the center of attention and will perform great feats of agility for you and your guests, especially if she is hungry or feeling left out of the conversation. She is a champ at feather game who will do somersaults on your hand to get rubbed in just the right place. She has a face like a Picasso and her ears have lynx type tips.
      While Nadia does not like to get picked up, she is a sweet lap cat who loves to be invited to sit with you, or preferably on you. She is very talkative and will carry on conversations with you and likes to be nearby and will even escort you around the house. She appears to prefer being indoors and content to watch activity outside from a window. She can be delightful company.
      Nadia's work out schedule requires that she have mostly wet food with pumpkin to keep things moving but otherwise she appears quite healthy and fit. She is very diligent about using the scratching post and the litter box. She has a hearty appetite and loves a treat of cream now and then.</p>

He likes to be close to you when you are relaxing either sitting right on you or sitting nearby. He will come to you when he sees you recumbent. He likes to play with Da Bird and will race around the house for aminute or two every now and then. Mostly, he likes to sit and watch the world go by or curl up and nap.

He is very smart and tends to look for an escape route when left alone outside. Midnight needs a home where he can run and play so apartments aren't a good fit.

Experience with terriers is preferred since we have a lot of personality and training needs packed into our scruffy little bodies!I will do best in an adult only home as I get very nippy when I am playing and am not comfortable being picked up. I will happily jump right into your lap for some love though!Because I am not comfortable when alone, I will need another social, patient dog or a pack to be a part of. My dog friends at the shelter have helped me learn how to be a dog and even how to play with other dogs! I do not want to lose that in my new home by being the only dog in my new home. When alone, I have displayed some separation anxiety related behaviors. I am looking for a family familiar with working with a dog with separation anxiety.

      <h2>Zoe</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Zoe has been a highly affectionate, quirky part of my household. Let me see if I can describe her for you.
      Zoe, after being fearful and reserved when she arrived, has slowly shown that she loves social contact, both with humans and other cats. She comes to hop into my lap whenever I sit down to work at my computer or settle in to do some reading in my recliner. I barely get into bed at night before I find her curled up at the top of my bed, near my head. I sometimes wake in the morning to find her asleep on my back! She's also tries to stay engaged with Shermy, my old male cat. (He's sort ofa grump, so she doesn't get much success.)</p><p>
      Zoe loves to bask in the sunshine that (occasionally!) comes in through my south facing windows. She also enjoys playing with catnip toys, most frequently thumping a cigar-shaped toy with her back legs.</p><p>
      Zoe is a voracious eater - she can sometimes make a mess with her dry food, but she ends up eating all of it. She doesn't seem to get overweight, despite her appetite. She's never had a litter box problem and is in good health.</p><p>
      Zoe has quirks. As I mentioned, she was highly fearful when she came to my home. She spent ~ 4 days hiding behind the toilet in my bathroom and then another ~ 8 days hiding under my living room couch before she started to come out into the daily flow of events. Her fearfulness and withdrawal do not disappear at some specific point; rather, she gradually, gradually, gradually gives them up. She's loyal and loving, but it takes time to earn those feelings from her.</p><p>
      Zoe walks and trots normally around my home, but has a problem with her hind legs such that she can only jump small heights. She can hop up onto my couch, but cannot go even a few inches higher onto my bed or my computer chair. I've gotten three small "pet steps" that I've strategically put around my home, so we no longer face Zoe trying to climb and pull herself up to desired heights.</p><p>
      I hope these comments give you a feeling for Zoe. I'm certainly glad to answer any questions you might have. You're also welcome to come to my home if you'd like, although both Zoe and Shermy are almost certain to run and hide during your visit!</p>

      <div class="description">
      <p>Biscuit is waiting to play with you. Biscuit is a shy, 9 month old brown and black tabby who weighs a whopping 5 lbs! He can be somewhat reluctant when it comes to handling by people. We feel he will require a home with an outgoing "mentor" cat to show him the kitty ropes. This shy guy would benefit greatly from a quiet home where he can play and just be a kitten. Due to his shyness, we are looking for an experienced cat owner who can get used to associating pets with love. Biscuitwas found as a stray with his littermate in the Yakima area. He has lived with other cats and did well, but we don't know how he would do with dogs. Small children would be too overwhelming for Biscuit, so we are recommending teens and adults in his new home. Show this shy guy some love, won't you?</p>

      <p>Meet Rennie, one of our new rescue arrivals! This handsome 6 year old terrier mix boy is eager to start the search for his forever home in the Seattle area. Rennie came to us with a heartbreaking story, having been dumped in a California shelter where he was so scared that he rapidly lost weight due to stress and fear. Since then, Rennie has come such a long way, in part due to the help from various rescue groups and fosters who would not give up on him! Rennie started out very under-socialized, but after 6 weeks of training with Tug Dogs in Sacramento and tons of treats and love, Rennie is well on his way to being a very well-behaved boy! Agile, playful and affectionate, Rennie is a big fan of walks and edible chew toys and would make a great companion for someone with an active lifestyle. Though Rennie is not fond of crating or kenneling, he is great with other large dogs his size that can give him clear social cues, as he is still learning the ropes. Because Rennie is extremely curious and active, a fully fenced and completely secure yard is required for his safety. An experienced adopter is preferred, but anyone ages 10 years old and up that have patience, guidance, and plenty of love to offer would be a welcome fit for Rennie!

      <h2>Godiva</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Godiva is a bashful, shy girl here with her best friend, Kit Kat. They are looking for a fabulous new home they can share. Godiva is quite bashful, and Kit Kat is the confident and outgoing kitty of the pair. They are looking for a quiet, adult only home where Godiva can really settle in and be comfortable. Kit Kat quickly adjusts to new situations and is eager to explore! He and Godiva are often found playing or snuggling with each other. They are such an adorable pair! While Kit Kat is a confident guy, it's important they find a home familiar with shy cat behavior for Godiva's sake. She will need a little extra TLC to come out of her shell, and needs a patient adopter to help her with that. If you are interested in this dynamic duo, come by today to say hello!</p></div>

      <div class="description">
      <p>Hi, my name is Hazel. My previous owner says I am as gentle as a lamb. I do like to play with strings and feathers, but am also low energy and like to relax. It looks like I may have some allergies that affect my skin and fur, so the shelter staff has put me on a hypoallergenic diet, which is by prescription only. If you think I would be a great addition to your home, please be aware that I will require regular veterinary care and possibly medication.</p></div>

      <h2>Jackson</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Say hello to Jackson! This handsome 1 year old domestic shorthair tabby boy is looking forward to starting the search for his forever home in the Seattle area. Jackson came to our rescue after his owner was unable to provide him with the attention and affection Jackson loves most, yet he is optimistic that he will find another family to give him those things and even more! Fans of quiet wallflower cats look elsewhere, because Jackson is a very, very chatty boy who loves to talk up a storm. Jackson is a classic “tree dweller” and loves to perch in lofty spots to observe the world below, but he will also happily accept a window ledge to gaze at the passing birds! Like many cats, Jackson is sensitive to stress and changes in his environment and would do best in a quiet home with children 14 years old and older. However, Jackson previously lived with another cat and a dog without any scuffles, so by all accounts he is a pretty easygoing roommate to other critters! Jackson is incredibly bright and social and would thrive in a home that can provide him with plenty of attention, mental enrichment, playtime, and affection! Not a very tall order, if you ask us – and if you ask Jackson as in the photo above, he will happily agree!
      Jackson is fully vetted, neutered, and microchipped. Please call 206-557-4661 for more information on Jackson!</p>

This darling Boston Terrier duo is excited to start the search for their forever home in the Seattle area, and if you don’t believe us, just look at their faces for proof! Simba and Zaria arrived at our rescue after their family couldn’t keep them due to moving, but these two still maintain twice the upbeat attitude despite it all.

Simba and Zaria do everything in tandem and feed off of each other’s silly antics, which will leave you doubled over in laughter, and they can never seem to stop smiling! Cuddly and affectionate, this pair gets along fine with other dogs and would do beautifully in a home with humans ages 10 years old and older.

      <p>Say hello to Slurpee, one of our new rescue arrivals! At only 4 years old, Slurpee spent the first part of his life at a breeder and is very happy to get the search underway for his forever home! Slurpee has had some experiences in his past that cause him to be very fearful of new people and situations, so a slow approach is the name of the game when it comes to winning his sweet little heart. Slurpee can be vocal when he is distressed so he would do best in a house rather than an apartment or condo. Because he is so easily frightened, he would prefer a home with adults only. Slurpee gets along for the most part with other dogs his size, yet can be a bit possessive of laps that he loves – however, this smart little boy takes correction well and would benefit from training to increase his bravery and trust with people and dogs alike! Once you have won Slurpee over, a full diet of cuddles, kisses and tail wags is on the menu with a side of loyalty and love to match. If you have the patience and understanding to help a boy like Slurpee be the best boy he can be, Slurpee would love to meet you!

      <h2>Snowflake</h2><div class="description">
      <p>Meet Snowflake! 4 year old Snowflake came all the way from Soi Dogs in Thailand to join the ECPR family! Cute, independent Snowflake likes to be cuddled and would love to be a family’s one-and-only until she feels safe and secure. Great on walks and great with handling, Snowflake would likely benefit from crate training to keep her safe from harm when left at home alone. Because of her smarts, Snowflake can be precocious, so she demands a job and / or lots of physical and mental activity to keep her from being destructive (toys and chewy treats would help). Like her Soi Dog mates, Snowflake can be vocal and could escape if given the chance, so a house with a fenced-in yard is a must for her safety (no apartments or condos, please). Among Snowflake’s other requirements are no cats or kids under 12 years old in the home, and an experienced adopter who will show her the ropes through mandatory training which she is more than game for. Lastly, Snowflake has lost her vision in her right eye, and there is a slight possibility that down the road, she may lose sight in her other eye, so experience with blind dogs or special needs pets is a bonus. Can you open your heart and home to this beautiful girl?

      <h2>Snowflake</h2><div class="description">
      <p>Meet Snowflake, a five-year-old terrier mix. Snowflake is a sweet, gentle and sophisticated lady who is finally looking for her forever home. She loves to be with her people and her walks are the highlight of her day. She has learned lots of manners and tricks while in foster and comes with a long resume of commands (she's already house trained!). She loves to play fetch and tug, zoom through the yard with her stuffies, and especially loves to snuggle up with her people on these cold fall days (or anytime really)! Her foster dad says, "She plays like a puppy and snoozes like a senior".
      </p><p>
      Snowflake ended up at the shelter by no fault of her own. She was rescued from a bad situation and had to wait in the shelter's foster care until the courts awarded her to us for adoption. While Snowflake's foster parents have done an amazing job of helping those wounds heal, she can occasionally be unsure of new people, dogs or situations. Her trust is earned over time. She's a sensitive girl, responds to the lightest of tones, and is eager to learn. Her ideal home would continue to be a safe, gentle environment that enjoys leisurely walks and a bit of a couch-potato lifestyle. Right now, she would love to be your one-and-only pet, and given her past, we think she deserves all your love, attention and snuggles.</p></div>

These two 10 year old Chihuahua mix gals are raring to go, eager to start the search for their forever home in the Seattle area. Sophy came to our rescue with “cherry eye” in both eyes, but she is wiggling with excitement to have them removed soon! Tippy has been a great help to Sophy through all of the changes they’ve experienced, and the comfort they provide each other in this bonded pair has made all the difference. Sophy and Tippy are both friendly, sweet, affectionate ladies whose tails rarely stop wagging! Tippy especially likes to give kisses to her human friends, while Sophy likes to talk… and talk… and talk… which is why they would be best suited for a house rather than an apartment or condo. While Tippy is climbing into your lap for a cuddle, Sophy can be found conquering all of the plushy toys in the room, as the girls seem equally devoted to making people smile! Sophy and Tippy would do best in a home with respectful children 14 years old and older, and in exchange for giving them the love and attention they deserve, they promise to return all that and more for many years to come!

When Sprocket's family developed allergies that prevented him from staying in the home, Sprocket found his way to us and has been charming everyone he has met at our rescue ever since! Sprocket is very near perfection – he is whip smart, knows many commands, is incredibly affectionate and friendly, and gets along beautifully with other dogs of all sizes and young children, too! The only thing Sprocket loves more than fitting three tennis balls in his mouth or romping at the dog park is the cuddle time he shares with his humans. This gentle boy is a wonderful combination of active and mellow, and he would be well-suited for either a family with children, or as some lucky bachelor or bachelorette’s wingman. Sprocket the giant lap dog has a list of amazing qualities as giant as he is – but don’t take our word for it, take a chance on Sprocket and see for yourself - you won’t be disappointed!

      <p>Meet Thelma! This 7 years young Shepherd mix lady came all the way from Soi Dogs in Thailand to join the ECPR family! Thelma is super smart as well as treat motivated. She learns very quickly. Thelma is goofy and sweet, and while she gets along well with a lot of dogs, she would thrive in a home with individualized attention where required training with an experienced adopter would help her to grow in her obedience, manners, and trust (particularly with food guarding, her biggest area for improvement). Because she can be vocal and likes to bolt, a house with a fenced yard is the name of the game for Thelma – so no apartments or condos, please. Thelma enjoys playing with most people, yet requires a home without children under 12 years old and a highly active family is a must to keep her healthy and happy. Thelma LOVES water, so Thelma is hoping to meet a family that loves water as much as she does…like someone who would put a kiddie pool in the yard for her to splash and play in on warm days! Thelma is not a fan of cats (maybe because they don’t like water as much as she does!) so a cat-free home is a must.

Toby is a total trainer favorite and comes equipped with basic commands to start, in part because he is such a people pleaser! This beautiful brindle boy is known for having a gentle, easygoing disposition and being extremely affectionate with his humans. Toby is a delight to take on walks (though he could use help with pulling due to his large size), and enjoys playing fetch with a ball, going on hikes, and making people smile! Don’t let Toby’s ability to keep up with an active person fool you, though – while he enjoys the activity, he is also just as happy to join you for a Netflix binge on the couch because he can be a very mellow fellow.

Walter displays shyness and some fear around new people and situations, yet with a patient and understanding person to show him the ropes and support him in his progress, Walter has shown an immense capacity for loyalty and love. Due to his need for behavioral rehabilitation, Walter would thrive best as the only dog in a house (no apartments or condos) without children. Walter has had surgery for IVDD, and while he can stand on all four legs, he is limited in mobility and has partial control of his bladder and bowels. A good way to win Walter’s heart is through treats, which he loves – almost as much as he enjoys walks, where Walter becomes a confident, friendly boy to people passing by!

      <p>Meet Miss Honeybee! She is the funniest lady.....she is a mini purebred 11 year old shar pei, 30lbs....she was originally found a stray in Los Angeles in an overcrowded shelter, so we got this darling little ole lady up here to Seattle and give her a chance.
      </p><p>
      We immediately got her into the vet and found she is deaf and blind....BUT not permanently!!! Her loss of sight is caused from dry eye being left untreated and since we have been treating the layers of pigment have been slowly going away and no signs of dry eye so they are healing!!! Paws are crossed for full vision!
      </p><p>
      She gets along just fine and once she knows the layout just rarely bumps into things, she always knows when it is breakfast and dinner time and makes it known if you are not punctual! She is full of life and personality. She is healthy otherwise and gets around just fine. She so deserves to finish living out her life in a healthy loving environment. She does great taking her eye drops which she will need the rest of her life.
      </p><p>
      She does great with other dogs unless they try to sleep with her..she is so funny ...she even uses the doggie door! Loves being outside....finds things to scratch her back with and just plain knows what she wants in life! It only takes her a minute when a stranger walks in the door...the only time she barks to let us know....in case we couldn't see them!! Because she is a senior she also puts in for her naps!
      </p><p>
      Please contact Kelly at K9WRINKLES@AOL.COM if you are interested in adopting or fostering. You will not find Honeybee or any of the MEOW dogs at the cat shelter...all MEOW dogs are in foster homes. Thank you for looking to adopt not shop!</p></div>

Since then, Lucy Lynn has been visibly saddened by the loss and major change to her life, but has been making great strides in our care as we dote on her with cuddles, attention, and affection! Lucy Lynn is a very sweet girl who loves to be on laps or stretched out on her back for afternoon naps, but she has quite the spry side, too! Lucy Lynn is easy on the eyes for certain, but you cannot imagine how cute she is when she romps with you and chases you around the room playfully. When Lucy Lynn is having a lot of fun, she will go into an adorable play bow and make the funniest little sounds! We haven’t found Lucy Lynn’s favorite treat yet, but she adores the company of people (ladies especially) and would make a wonderful companion for anyone seeking a fluffy little lap dog friend. Lucy Lynn would do best as the only dog in the home and would be just fine with respectful kids 12 years old and older. Lucy Lynn can be vocal at times, so no apartments or condos for this gal.

      <p>T-bone is a sweet senior Shar Pei with plenty of love left to give. He adores getting attention and his tail is always wagging but he is also content to be on his own. If given the choice he would rather be outside than in so the ideal situation for him would be a fenced yard with a covered area where he could just hang out in his bed regardless of the weather. He actually prefers to sleep outside but that would be a problem in the winter. He currently has hip issues so a home without stairs would be preferred. He has problems making it thru a dog door but he'll let you know when he needs to go outside.
      He is very gentle with children but has issues with small dogs and cats so that would not be an option. He is good with older dogs but his mobility issues sometimes makes it hard for him to get out of the way which some dogs react to as aggression.
      Everyone who has met T-bone instantly falls in love with him. We hope you will too. Poor T Bone only got turned into the shelter as his owner passed away....not his fault!

      <h2>Nate</h2><div class="description">
      <p>Hey, I'm Nate! At ten months old I'm just a big puppy who's very energetic, athletic and exuberant! I arrived at the shelter as a stray, and I'm really looking forward to having a family and home of my very own.
      While I haven't had much training, I'm a smart guy, and already I've learned to sit politely when offered a tasty treat. I'm super food motivated, and am sure to be a star in manners class. In case you didn't notice, I'm one handsome dude! My coat is sleek and shiny and my eyes twinkle with glee.
      </p><p>
      Stuff I'd probably be great at - agility, fly ball, hiking and jogging, swimming and fetch! My ideal home will be as active and athletic as me, and have some prior dog experience. I'm good with kids age ten and up, and, I really prefer humans to other dogs. Let's meet! </p></div>

      <h2>Poli</h2><div class="description">
      <p>Poli is a special puppy that is in need of a home that understands her. She is frightened of new situations and people. Her reaction is to bark, growl and sometimes nip. She really wants a lap to sleep on and a family to love her. Right now Poli will need an adult only home until she goes through training and learns to trust. She does like other dogs her size but will be too scared of large dogs.</p></div>

      <h2>Wenatchee</h2><div class="description">
      <p>This tiny little pup Wenatchee has been in foster care his entire life getting lots of love and socialization. His mom weighs about 17lbs so he will likely be around the same size or smaller. We don't know what breed he is but we are guessing they are Chihuahua/Terrier mixes.</p></div>

      <h2>Faux Pas</h2><div class="description">
      <p>Hi, my name is Faux Pas! I am very nervous and don't like fast, darting movements towards me. I will come to you if you are patient and let me check you out, I will reward you with kisses. I love my walks with the AVHS volunteers, they say I love to run in the back yard and jump when I'm out walking. If you would like to meet me, please ask the front desk staff for assistance.</p></div>
