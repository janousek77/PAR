      <img src="animal_pics/cats/adult/Bailey.jpg" height="200" width="200"/>
      <p>Bailey is a 9 year kitty that lost the only family he ever knew when they adopted a dog. Bailey got too scared and stressed out and they decided to surrender him. When he came to our rescue we found out that he had some neurological problems. These problems make him walk with a swagger. He chirps, loves catnip toys, dinner and is an overall social fellow.</p>

      <p>Baldwin is quite the handsome gentleman. He will charm anyone with his movie star good looks. He takes some time to adjust, so he would probably fare better with a cat savvy owner. But once he warms up, he's the sweetest peach in the garden. Looks wise, we'd say he's like a fine wine, he'll just get better with age.

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/adult/Becky.jpg" height="200" width="200"/>
      <p>Becky is an adult cat overflowing with kittenish charms. A diminutive, six-pound bundle of enthusiasm, Becky will bound after you from room to room, chirping happily at frequencies conducive to echolocation. Expect enormous green eyes to meet your own when you open kitchen cabinets; Becky is an intrepid explorer undaunted by heights. Her athletic prowess belies every one of her nine years. A playful presence, Becky is often on the move, patrolling her territory and stalking catnip mice. (Although the hunt usually ends with Becky sprawled across the floor, belly to the sky.)
      Becky is as cuddlesome as she is playful. She loves to be scratched under the chin and will express her approbation in a purr loud enough to set her tiny frame quivering. She loves to sleep on the bed (and on its occupant.) Becky can never get enough of human attention; she's also fine with other cats and children.</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/adult/Bob.jpg"/ height="200" width="200"/>
      <p>Hi, my name is Bob and I love attention! Don't let my tipped ear and rugged good looks fool you; I am a very gentle and affectionate boy who loves being petted and sitting on laps.
      My personality type has been described as a SECRET ADMIRER, and here's what that means:
      When it comes to relationships, I'm very level-headed. I don't leap in paws first, if you know what I mean. But give me a little time, and then I'll shower you with purrs, head-butts, and plenty of lap time. In the meantime, you may not see a lot of me - but I'll be thinking a lot of you.
      This wonderful cat has tested positive for FIV. What exactly does that mean? FIV is a cat-only disease and cannot be passed on to humans or other non-felines. It is highly unlikely that an altered, FIV+ cat would spread the disease to other cats in the home - it is only transmitted through blood, and would require a very serious, deep bite wound to do so. This disease predominantly hits unaltered roaming tomcats, fighting to defend their territory.
      FIV is a disease of the immune system, and for this reason an FIV+ cat must live indoors only. The good news is that the majority of these cats live long, happy, relatively normal lives with no symptoms at all. Please consider opening up your heart and your home to this deserving cat. Be sure to speak with the shelter officers if you have further questions. Thank you!</p>

      <p>Casey is the prettiest girl in the whole world, and she just needs someone to reassure her that. Casey is very shy, and has a hard time coming out of her shell. She will need a very special person to help her open up, and be very patient with her. Do you have room in your heart to fit Casey in?

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/adult/Cece.jpg" height="200" width="200"/>
      <p>CeCe is a tender-hearted soul who will reward you with love once you've gained her trust. Her past circumstances didn't allow her the calm atmosphere or unencumbered space she enjoys, and now she's looking for a home with a more patient and loving family. Her shy nature doesn't mean she'll spend all of her time exploring remote areas of the house though. CeCe loves cheek rubs, belly scratches, and being brushed. Once she learns to trust in your steady and caring presence, she'll begin seeking you out.
      Because of her disposition, CeCe is on a daily dose of anti-anxiety medication that is easily crushed and mixed into her food. She takes her medicine easily and loves you most when you put out a bowl of food for her to eat. If you give CeCe some love and chat with her about your day, she'll enjoy talking back to you with a sweet little meow. Sometimes you may hear her give a half-hearted hiss, but that's only when she's startled; after that immediate reaction she will shortly return to the sweet cat you know and love. Toys and treats definitely help her warm up to you, and it doesn't hurt if you have a toasty warm sunspot in your house either.
      CeCe would do best with a mature owner who has previous cat experience and can let her flourish as the only animal in the house. CeCe has good litter box habits and is easily able to entertain herself during the day. But don't stay away too long, because she'll want you back to play with her string toy. Be bold and give a call to see if CeCe could be the perfect match for you!</p>

I'll bump you with my head to show you how much I love it! I like to play with my cat friends, and I'm starting to get the hang of playing with toys too! I'd be happiest going home with an outgoing, playful cat like Leucoco so that I can learn more about being a confident cat!

      <p>Kitterman is a sweet and loving companion who accepts his pettings with a loud and encouraging purr. He spends a great deal of the afternoons lounged out on the bed, with some breaks for affection here and there. He loves watching the birds from the window, or when they're not around, playing with his ever-so-enticing string toy. Kitterman is outgoing and playful, and if you dare neglect to pet him he will remind you with a sweet and gentle headbutt. Kitterman is a bit dominant by nature, and he would do best as the only furry friend in the household.</p>

      <p>I'm very outgoing and love to play with toys, humans, and cat friends! If I don't get enough playtime or attention, I get a little feisty and might nibble on some toes or play with shoes! I have very good litterbox manners, but sometimes I make a little mess when I'm eating. I really like attention, but when you pet me please go nice and slow so I don't think it's playtime!

She didn't get the medical attention she needed and her kidney disease progressed. She had two homes already, but for one reason or another she ended up back to the rescue. Not her fault, other than needing a little extra care. Because of her kidney disease, she needs sub Q fluids, which she accepts easily. She has a special diet that she gets her medicine in. This is the sweetest cat in the whole world. She would like a home to live in as well as people to love her and take care of her. She is social, talkative and a complete charmer.

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/adult/Opal.jpg"/   height="200" width="200"/>
      <p>OPAL was brought to SAS in late November, along with 2 or 3 other cats. Her ‘sad eyes' look seems to mirror a short indoor/outdoor lifestyle, without much care from her former humans. She was in poor condition and very pregnant, ready to deliver kittens at time of surrender.
      She was taken into a foster home and her overall condition has improved considerably since that time.
      Her age is unknown but her behavior and activity level is that of a very young cat, possibly 1 or 2 years old.
      A little shy with strangers, she is receptive to kindness and attention from people. As a pretty, flame point Siamese cat, her talkative nature seems to fit the traits of her breed. Her routine chatter is easily distinguished from a tone of distress when something upsets her.
      Opal delivered five kittens the day after Thanksgiving and devoted her attention to them for nearly three months. Though not much is known about her former stay with prior owner, she did not like the other cats in the household. She has retained some wariness from earlier experiences, though she can be in same room with other cats, as long as they don't confront her. Based on that discomfort, she would probably do best in a quiet household with no other pets or small children. However, she continued to enjoy the company of her five kittens, even as they became very independent and more interactive with each other. Opal has been seen on many occasions chasing her very active kittens, playing with them and with favorite toys.
      Four of her kittens are recently adopted or about to be adopted. That still leaves an opportunity for Opal to have a companion in a new home if she is adopted with her remaining daughter, Onyx (in the photos with her). They get along well with each other, are both playful, and receptive to human attention.
      Do you have a home to offer this sweet cat, and give her a chance for a better life in a loving home?

      <p>Pinky is an outgoing, curious and loving kitty that, once comfortable, will sit on your lap in the day and snuggle with you at night. She loves to look out the window and longs to catch the birds feeding outside. Because she is polydactyl, her paws look like little mittens! She enjoys food, maybe a little too much, so her diet must be closely monitored. As a long haired kitty, she requires daily brushing to keep her coat free of tangles. Come meet this sassy lady!</p>

      <p>I'm still getting used to having humans in my life, so please be patient with me when I get scared! Once I'm comfortable I like to talk and love a slow, gentle head rub! I play well with my cat friends, but I'm still getting the hang of playing with toys. I'd do best if I go home with an outgoing, playful cat like Grita, so that I can watch and learn how to adjust to humans from her!

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/adult/Ryder.jpg"/   height="200" width="200"/>
      <p>Ryder is a sweet, handsome little tabby who is somewhat shy but in the week or so he's been in foster care he's warmed up a lot and is getting calmer and friendlier every day. He likes exploring and finding Ryder-sized hiding spots around the house that he can spy on you from. Despite being somewhat skittish he's very hungry for attention - when you stop petting him he will hop up and down and sometimes stand on his hind legs to try to get you to come back. He loves being brushed and using blankets to wrap himself up like a tiny, furry burrito. Ryder would benefit from a quiet household and a little time and patience to help him come out of his shell.</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/adult/Shadow.jpg"/   height="200" width="200"/>
      <p>Are you in search of a smart, handsome, and playful cat who also loves to snuggle next to you and is an excellent biscuit maker? Well, Shadow may be the cat to end your search. This 3 year old classic tuxedo kitty leans into or stands on his back feet during ear/neck/chin rubs and pets to show his appreciation. He also enjoys being picked up, held and of course given some ear rubs at the same time. If you haven't been giving him enough attention he will remind you with a meow or two or three. His toys of choice are string toys and soft catnip toys. His foster hasn't seen him play with ping pong balls or jingle balls, but she has heard him play with them. With Shadow being such a smart feline, his foster mom is working with him on some ticks using his favorite, seafood flavored crunchy treats, as his prize. Shadow will need a person who has cat experience, so he isn't the feline for a first time cat parent. Come meet the cat who will always be impeccably dressed.</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/adult/Sonny.jpg"/   height="200" width="200"/>
      <p>Sonny is a beautiful Red Tabby with Harlequin coloration. He is a healthy, chubby 4 year old, whose previous owner had to give him up because she couldn't find housing that would accept pets.
      Sonny seems to be a one-person cat, who enjoys company and affection, once he gets to know you.
      Sonny is challenging at first, because he has problems establishing trust. To be clear, he can be very fearful and even aggressive toward strangers, until he learns to trust. He needs a very cat-savvy adopter who will take the time to get Sonny to trust you. We suspect that he prefers women to men.
      Sonny is in dire need of being adopted, because his present foster mom, a frequent rescue foster parent, cannot keep him. We need to make room for more fosters, as the difficult-to-adopt ones keep coming in!</p>
