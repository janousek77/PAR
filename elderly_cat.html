      <h2>Cali</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Cali is the sweetest and most cuddly cat I've ever gotten to know so I have no doubt that someone will easily fall in love with her! She came into the shelter in bad shape with super itchy and bothersome skin allergies but we've figured out how to help her enjoy life again! Cali is hoping that the right person will be so happy to have such a sweet and lovable girl in their life that they will be OK with the few extra needs she's got. She eats a prescription food (licks her bowl clean!) gets a 1/4 pill every 3 days (she's easy to pill!) and the vet recommends giving her Advantage monthly (gosh, this could be any cat!). Cali wants to find someone who doesn't have too many other critters in the house and is generous with their belly scratches!</p>

      <h2>Eddie</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Searching for someone to inspire you? Eddie sets a perfect example of how to overcome challenges with a sunny spirit. This pretty tuxedo kitty is one of the most affectionate cats you'll ever meet. She loves cheek and chin rubs, curling up on laps, sleeping in the sun with her belly showing, and snuggling by her foster mom's shoulder so she can share the pillow. She also likes to sprawl with her legs in front of her to groom her tummy, sitting up like a person while she cares for her extra soft and velvety coat. She is a confident, chatty girl and a lively companion.</p><p>
      Eddie is mildly vision-impaired (although you wouldn't know it from looking at her beautiful green eyes) but she doesn't let it bother her at all and uses all her other senses to compensate for her poor eyesight. She is very vocal, purring constantly and talking to you in her unique voice. She loves to chase her bird toy and her rattling ball - both of these toys make noise so she can track them easily. She tends to play with all four paws on the ground, or rolling on her back, instead of jumping. She uses her sense of touch too, sometimes gently tapping her person to communicate, especially at mealtime. She manages her vision impairment very well and her foster parent can share tips to help mitigate its impact on her life.</p><p>
      Eddie is also FIV+, but in good health for her age and doesn't take any medications. For more information about living with an FIV+ cat, please visit </p>

      <h2>Ike</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Ike is an elegant, soft-maned gentleman looking for a quiet and loving new home with cat-experienced adults. This handsome 12-year-old loves being petted and brushed, and will happily curl up in any warm laps that come his way. He enjoys playing with Q-tips, too.</p><p>
      Because Ike is declawed, he'll do best as his new family's only pet, and he should live strictly indoors. This gentle, mellow boy is full of affection, but he likes to bestow it on his own terms. Come meet this reserved but lovable kitty and see if he's the companion you've been searching for.</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/elderly/Katniss.jpg"/>
      <h2>Katniss</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Katniss is an awesome feline! She's a master lap cat, a great snuggler and even intuitive - knowing when you've had a tough day and need her extra comfort. She's got a hearty, deep purr and will gaze at you intently with her expressive, green eyes. Katniss would love to greet your guests are the door, hang out on the back of your couch or even play with your existing feline friend!</p><p>
      In return, for her good natured and enviable cat personality, Katniss needs a little extra TLC from her adopter. She's got diabetes, but she's on a very low dose of insulin and takes her medicine without fuss. In return, she will be a very bonded companion to you and so happy to have a home to call her own!
      This warm and patient Katniss is good with kids who understand how to read a cat's signals. She'd do well in a moderately active home and would enjoy the company of a feline friend. Call the foster care hotline above to schedule a time to meet Katniss. </p>

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/elderly/Lillie.jpg"/>
      <h2>Lillie</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Lillie is a fabulous, independent, (almost) 9-year old, delightful girl. We have had the awesome experience being her foster parents. She took her sweet time getting to know us, preferring to hang alone than with us. And we let her. Well, I have to admit, I tried to get to be her friend before she wanted me to. She's just SO cute looking, I couldn't resist! Lillie is a gray tabby with a thick black stripe along her spine and a darling white, tan and gray face. Her eyes are green and her paws are white.</p><p>
      Lillie has a funny personality and she will let you know when she wants to eat and when you need to clean her litter box (twice a day) and when she wants you to follow her somewhere (usually the kitchen for food) and when she wants you to pet her. Lillie is very vocal, so you'll know what she wants and when she wants it. She will definitely make you laugh. Lillie will not do well with other pets or commotion in a house. She would prefer a single person or couple without children. Other than all that, she is one perfect cat. She doesn't jump up on furniture or kitchen counters. She has perfect litter box habits.</p></div>

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/elderly/Lilyput.jpg"/>
      <h2>Lilyput</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Lilyput is a sweet and gentle 12 year old girl. While being very independent, she loves a scratch behind her ears and under her chin. Lilyput enjoys human company and will gladly sit next to you while you watch TV or read a book. She loves a good catnip toy and will playfully roll around with it for hours. Lilyput is tolerant of other cats but would do best in a quiet home without small kids. One look into her big blue eyes and you will fall in love with Lilyput.</p><p>
      Being a 12 year old cat, Lilyput does have some kidney-related medical issues; therefore, she must be fed a kidney-care diet. She gladly eats this food and will let you know when she wants some more!</p><p>
      I'm happy to introduce you to Miss Panda. She was first adopted out from Seattle Animal Shelter when she was just a kitten. 12 years later she was returned by workers employed to remove trash from an apartment where she was found. Panda was neglected and distrustful when she first arrived back at SAS. When taken in as a foster she immediately flourished into an affectionate and joyful cat who quickly claimed a favorite window sill to watch the world go by and a favorite hiding place in the back of the closet to take a nap in private. But most of all she likes company and is quick to nestle near her favorite person in hopes of getting some attention. She enjoys her catnip toys and is a diligent user of her cat scratcher. She is also dependable on using the litter box.
      She often comes excitedly to the door to greet you when you arrive home. This seems to happen more when she is fed her preference, canned food</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/elderly/Missy.jpg"/>
      <h2>Missy</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Missy is an extremely snuggly and loving cat and is always looking for a warm lap to stretch out on. She loves to be pet (especially behind and around her ears) and is often eager for belly rubs. Missy is a quiet cat, perfect for an apartment setting with neighbors, or a quiet home. She is friendly to new guests and her gentle purr and silky soft fur will will draw them in. She enjoys the occasional play, but generally spends her time stretched out on a cozy surface. Missy will make an excellent companion for a cat-experienced, calm, and mature household</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/elderly/Nadia.jpg"/>
      <h2>Nadia</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Nadia is a spritely petite kitty who will wow you with her acrobatic skill. She likes to be the center of attention and will perform great feats of agility for you and your guests, especially if she is hungry or feeling left out of the conversation. She is a champ at feather game who will do somersaults on your hand to get rubbed in just the right place. She has a face like a Picasso and her ears have lynx type tips.
      While Nadia does not like to get picked up, she is a sweet lap cat who loves to be invited to sit with you, or preferably on you. She is very talkative and will carry on conversations with you and likes to be nearby and will even escort you around the house. She appears to prefer being indoors and content to watch activity outside from a window. She can be delightful company.
      Nadia's work out schedule requires that she have mostly wet food with pumpkin to keep things moving but otherwise she appears quite healthy and fit. She is very diligent about using the scratching post and the litter box. She has a hearty appetite and loves a treat of cream now and then.</p>

      <img src="animal_pics/cats/elderly/Oscar.jpg"/>
      <h2>Oscar</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Oscar is a sweet, easygoing, even-tempered, mild-mannered thirteen year old. He is shy at first but once he's comfortable he is affectionate and engaging. He comes when called because he knows he's going to get a pet or a good scratch or maybe just a little conversation. He likes to be close to you when you are relaxing either sitting right on you or sitting nearby. He will come to you when he sees you recumbent. He likes to play with Da Bird and will race around the house for a minute or two every now and then. Mostly, he likes to sit and watch the world go by or curl up and nap. He's good company and he will do best with a quiet house where he is the only animal. Oscar takes a low dose of medication daily but takes his pill like a pro!</p>

      <h2>Pumpkin</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Pumpkin is a friendly yet independent fellow who will make a wonderful companion. He loves attention - especially being brushed with the Zoom Groom - and also enjoys a daily play session or two with balls and other chase toys. Two of his favorite occasional treats are catnip and kitty grass, and he is a neat kitty who likes to use his scratching post. Pumpkin found himself at the shelter through no fault of his own because his owner had to move. He is confident in his fur and knows that he'd like his forever home to be with mature guardians who understand cats. If you admire a fellow who knows his mind, and are looking for a mellow and heartbreakingly handsome companion, Pumpkin may be the cat for you!</p></div>

      <h2>Rita</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Rita is a gentle, sweet lady looking for a quiet forever home to fill with her purrs. Although she's visually impaired she doesn't let this slow her down and eagerly explores new places and meets new people. She needs one pill in morning that she happily takes with food to treat her high blood pressure and prevent her vision from getting worse and food available from any vet to protect her kidneys. Rita loves pets and will often come to cuddle at night on your bed. Her favorite position is to sleep against you. She'll even wait quietly by the door at bedtime to make sure she gets her spot. Don't her big eyes just beg for some affection? Her calm demeanor is perfect for a relaxed household and she doesn't mind other cats as long as they don't invade her bubble. Let Rita warm up your home and bring a little peace to you today!</p>

      <h2>Samantha</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Sweet Samantha has many endearing qualities. She is friendly, affectionate, gentle, and as curious as every self-respecting cat should be. She enjoys being brushed and sitting on laps, and does not hesitate to share her soothing, steady purr. She currently shares her foster home with both cats and dogs and gets along well with them. She is quite spry and loves to chase the bird toy and bat at a cat nip mouse. Then she settles in for a nice nap, preferably on the bed right next to you. Samantha will make a wonderfully loving companion for some lucky person. Might that be you?</p><p>
      Like all sidekicks, I'm just plain good company. I like attention, and I also like my solitude. I don't go looking for trouble but I'm no scaredy-cat, either. If you are looking for a steady companion to travel with you on the road of life, look no further.</p></div>

    <a href="adoption.html" ><div class="imgContainer">
      <img src="animal_pics/cats/elderly/Zoe.jpg"/>
      <h2>Zoe</h2>
      <div class="description">
      <p>Zoe has been a highly affectionate, quirky part of my household. Let me see if I can describe her for you.
      Zoe, after being fearful and reserved when she arrived, has slowly shown that she loves social contact, both with humans and other cats. She comes to hop into my lap whenever I sit down to work at my computer or settle in to do some reading in my recliner. I barely get into bed at night before I find her curled up at the top of my bed, near my head. I sometimes wake in the morning to find her asleep on my back! She's also tries to stay engaged with Shermy, my old male cat. (He's sort of a grump, so she doesn't get much success.)</p><p>
      Zoe loves to bask in the sunshine that (occasionally!) comes in through my south facing windows. She also enjoys playing with catnip toys, most frequently thumping a cigar-shaped toy with her back legs.</p><p>
      Zoe is a voracious eater - she can sometimes make a mess with her dry food, but she ends up eating all of it. She doesn't seem to get overweight, despite her appetite. She's never had a litter box problem and is in good health.</p><p>
      Zoe has quirks. As I mentioned, she was highly fearful when she came to my home. She spent ~ 4 days hiding behind the toilet in my bathroom and then another ~ 8 days hiding under my living room couch before she started to come out into the daily flow of events. Her fearfulness and withdrawal do not disappear at some specific point; rather, she gradually, gradually, gradually gives them up. She's loyal and loving, but it takes time to earn those feelings from her.</p><p>
      Zoe walks and trots normally around my home, but has a problem with her hind legs such that she can only jump small heights. She can hop up onto my couch, but cannot go even a few inches higher onto my bed or my computer chair. I've gotten three small "pet steps" that I've strategically put around my home, so we no longer face Zoe trying to climb and pull herself up to desired heights.</p><p>
      I hope these comments give you a feeling for Zoe. I'm certainly glad to answer any questions you might have. You're also welcome to come to my home if you'd like, although both Zoe and Shermy are almost certain to run and hide during your visit!</p>
